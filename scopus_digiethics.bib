	abstract = {Contemporary HRM was introduced into Poland by the arrival of international corporations with their professional systems of Human Resource Management, which emphasizes ethical personnel management. This research is based on data collected from a questionnaire and interview of 40 women and men professional graduates of the 2004 Weekend MBA Program at Poznan University of Economics eliciting their perceptions of ethical issues in Polish HRM. The present Polish economic situation, with 19% unemployment, precipitates many ethical challenges. The questionnaire and interviews resulted in 217 observations and specific examples of ethical HRM issues. Examples fall in two broad categories and five specific Human Resource areas. The broad external categories are: (1) History and cultural attitudes and (2) Exploitation of the current unemployment situation. Historical and cultural attitudes influence attitudes toward work; company discipline; property and ownership; law and social expectations at work. The history of personnel departments in Socialistic Poland explains many of these attitudes. The five specific categories are: (1) Ethical issues in recruitment; (2) Ethical issues in hiring (Discrimination issues); (3) Ethical issues in performance appraisals and promotions; (4) Abuse of authority (including sexual harassment), and (5) "Mobbing". Ethical issues in these categories include correlation with appropriate Polish Labor and Penal Laws. This research reveals some HRM ethical challenges unique to Polish HRM. The research emphasizes professional HRM and ethical expectations, which are now being recognized and accepted as a strategic component of Polish management. © Springer 2006.},

A sample of 156 undergraduate business students read a fictitious news story in which an advertising watchdog group accused business executives of using digital manipulation to lighten the skin tone of a Black female model featured in a product print ad. Participants then answered questions on ethical perceptions, behavioral intentions, and prejudice toward Blacks. Results suggest that low-prejudice consumers have stronger ethical concerns toward the digital lightening of ethnic models in print ads than do high-prejudice consumers.

	abstract = {The ethical credentials of advertising in regard to young people have been questioned for some time. It is thus intriguing that the same scrutiny has never been directed at the concomitant practice of segmentation. Market segments are usually assumed to exist quite independently of the targeting process and are thus not considered within the same agenda as advertising. But what if advertisers influence the formation of segments? In this postulate, firms are not creating a product for a segment but instead are creating a segment for a product. Advertising and segmentation become interlinked and the ethical concerns expressed over advertising must also be applied to segmentation. The article highlights the link between advertising and segmentation and presents empirical evidence that adolescent attitude/value-based segments can be influenced by advertising. If this result can be generalized, the ethical debate on advertising needs to be widened to include the commercial practice of segmentation. © 2005 Sage Publications.},

	abstract = {This article argues that advertising ethics, traditionally focused on ad contents and vulnerable audiences, should be also applied to ad format intrusiveness. The increasing appearance of highly intrusive advertising formats resulted in an extraordinarily growth of ad blocking systems. To fight the economic costs of the ad blocker phenomenon, the most relevant agents of the industry have created a never seen Coalition for Better Ads including marketers, publishers, and agencies worldwide. This article analyses the experiments carried out by the Coalition to create Better Ads Standards establishing the limits of ad format intrusiveness to be implemented worldwide by means of self-regulation. Based on classical and current approaches to advertising ethics, this work explains that highly annoying ads should not only be banned for practical reasons but for overpassing ethical limits in terms of respect for the persuadee, equity of the persuasive appeal, and social responsibility for the common good. A basic exploratory replication study is presented to simulate further research on the ethical limits of intrusive advertising. Establishing which ad formats are allowed to continue and which ones should gradually disappear is such a relevant process for many stakeholders that it requires further discussion by consumers and scholars. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This article responds to calls for further research on ethical issues in advertising. The study examines whether advertising strategies which use female-disparaging themes are perceived as ethical, and what effect this has on ad and brand attitudes. It also examines whether or not humour assuages ethical evaluations of female-disparaging ads. The findings from an experimental research design, which included 336 British respondents, show that non-disparaging and non-humorous ads are considered to be the most ethical, while disparaging ads (regardless of the level of humour) are considered the least ethical. Across the board, female-disparaging ads are not perceived as ethical; however, high benevolent sexists appear to favour them most. Finally, an ad’s perceived ethicality mediates the relationship between ad disparagement and ad attitudes; likewise, an ad’s perceived ethicality and ad attitudes mediate the relationship between an ad’s female disparagement and brand attitudes. Female-disparaging ads should be avoided given that they are perceived as less ethical and given the impact that advertising has on behaviour, as well as on societal and moral values. Advertisers should also avoid using female-disparaging advertising themes, even light-hearted ones, since they constitute a risky strategy for the ad and the brand as they can backfire and alienate consumers. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.},

It provides a theoretically informed framework for recognizing and understanding ethical issues in visual representation. Design/methodology/approach - An interdisciplinary conceptual review and analysis focuses on four representational conventions, synthesizing ethical concerns, to provide a broader context for recognizing and understanding ethical issues in marketing representation: face-ism, idealization, exoticization and exclusion. This framework is discussed and applied to marketing communications. Findings - It argues that valuations of communication appropriateness must be informed by an awareness of the ethical relationship between marketing representations and identity. It is no longer satisfactory to associate advertising solely with persuasion, rather advertising must be seen as a representational system, with pedagogical as well as strategic functions. We conclude by discussing the theoretical, research, and managerial implications that arise from an ethics of visual representation. Originality/value - Urges moving beyond an advertising=persuasion model to encompass representation and culture in marketing communication studies. Contributes to understanding the ethical implications of marketing communication. Challenges marketers and researchers to broaden their conception of marketing communication to one more consistent with an image economy. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The purpose of our study therefore is to provide a first illustration of an emic and informant-based derivation of perceived ad ethics. The authors use multi-dimensional scaling as an approach enabling the emic, or locally derived deconstruction of perceived ad ethics. Given recent calls to develop our understanding of ad ethics in different cultural contexts, and in particular within the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, we use Lebanon—the most ethically charged advertising environment within MENA—as an illustrative context for our study. Results confirm the multi-faceted and pluralistic nature of ad ethics as comprising a number of dimensional themes already salient in the existing literature but in addition, we also find evidence for a bipolar relationship between individual themes. The specific pattern of inductively derived relationships is culturally bound. Implications of the findings are discussed, followed by limitations of the study and recommendations for further research. © 2018, The Author(s).},

What are the moral limits of the use of emotion as a management tool for shaping workplace behavior and influencing the thoughts and actions of consumers? Do the ethics of emotional labor and emotional appeals (e.g., in consumer advertising) depart from moral rules that apply in &quot;non-emotional&quot; contexts? To explore these questions we examine research on the means by which individuals' emotions are shaped and on the organizationally relevant consequences of individual emotional experience. We then discuss a number of potential ethical issues that are implicit or explicit in the organizationally sanctioned use of emotion management, incorporating existing literature in management and business ethics that has addressed the moral obligations of organizations in this context, and highlighting areas where there is yet work to be done.

	abstract = {Background. Considering the position and importance of sports federations in Iran and their very important duties and dependence on the Ministry of Sports and Youth in terms of financial resources, they must be responsive to their performance in providing services and implementing their programs. The duties are namely the development and promotion of sports at the public and championship levels, coordination of competitions at the local and national levels, selection of athletes, and training and development of national teams for participation in the international fields. Therefore, there is a growing need for a practical framework to improve the performance of sports federations. Objectives. The purpose of this study was to present an executive model for improving the performances of sports federations. Methods. Considering the qualitative and exploratory nature of the subject, the grounded theory was applied as a qualitative research method using the Glaser model. First, a preliminary list of effective factors was identified through primary studies. It was followed by semi-structured interviews conducted with 25 elites who were aware of the subject of the study. Results. The open coding results denoted that 83 indicators could improve the performances of the Iranian sports federations. At the axial coding stage, the indicators were classified into 19 concepts. Finally, the five categories of "management and leadership," "resources," "specific performance of federation," "information and communication," and "education and research affairs" were identified through selective coding. Conclusion.

	abstract = {Purpose - To examine the introduction of a practice known as Donation after Cardiac Death (DCD) into Australian hospitals notwithstanding that DCD constitutes a significant shift in medical practice. The shift is from holding off organ donation activities until after death has occurred (the Brain Death Scenario and Uncontrolled Cardiac Death Scenario) to progressing the injured patient to organ donor on the basis of an early prognostic call. The more precise term is 'Controlled DCD'. What is controlled are the timing, location, mode and criteria of death. Findings - Controlled DCD first appears as an 'inpatient trial' in Pittsburgh, United States, in 1992, and has progressed, via various organisations and committees, to being used in a number of countries, including Australia and New Zealand, and being embodied in national, state and hospital protocols. Along the way, concerns that previously precluded such activity have been consistently raised and documented. Operational accounts reported in the medical literature do not acknowledge this history or the ethically problematic aspects of the practice. It is likely that these operational reports and related information sources, together with promotion of the positives of organ donation, have facilitated the practice's progress through the relevant institutional committees. Social implications - Much is at stake when the quest for more organ donors starts changing what can be done to patients. How this practice has come to be tolerated in 2012, despite a number of irresolvable ethical issues, is a matter of vital community interest. Originality/value of chapter - This chapter is part of an ongoing study by the authors. Copyright © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

The main purpose of the study includes evaluation of attitudes to the moral issues in advertising practice as well as government policy on the problem of unethical advertising. The study applies methodological framework of policy analysis toward the regulation of unethical advertising in the countries of the EAEU. The authors find out that there is no coherent public policy in this field in the EAEU. While Russia attempts to apply international standards with self-regulation mechanisms in order to deal with unethical advertisements, the other member states prefer to use strict governmental control. In Russia, there are two opposite tendencies: While mass media assign part of regulation to the government, the government does not want to adopt this role. The courts in Russia prefer reactive regulation of advertising, usually trying to evade even obvious law cases. At the same time, facing no resistance from either governments or societies, some part of advertising industry tends to abuse ethic norms. The authors claim that this situation undermines the process of integration and differs significantly advertising industry in the countries of EAEU from advertising, for example, in the member states of the European Union. © Econjournals.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the importance of fair-trade communication activities in the buying decision-making process of chocolate. The role of emotional empathy in influencing the willingness to pay and the purchase intention was also explored. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey with a sample of 199 Italian chocolate consumers was conducted. Respondents were equally and randomly distributed among the four print advertising stimuli: conventional brand with conventional campaign; conventional brand with pro-social campaign; pro-social brand with conventional campaign; and pro-social brand with pro-social campaign. A between-subjects factorial design was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: Results showed the effectiveness of pro-social marketing campaigns in increasing consumers’ willingness to pay and purchase intention for fair-trade chocolate. Contextually, consumers with a high level of emotional empathy showed a greater purchase intention as opposed to those with a low level. Research limitations/implications: As the ethical nature of the product should be communicated in several ways, the effect of different types of textual information on the dependent variables should be considered. Originality/value: The study enriches the literature on ethical consumption and provides some guidance to manufacturers and product managers for understanding the role of pro-social marketing communication in influencing consumer behaviour. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

A survey employing a NA article was administered among adolescents (n = 610). The manipulation examined their ethical attitudes and credibility perceptions toward the NA articles before and after the persuasion knowledge. Findings strengthen research assumptions that most adolescents have encountered NA without recognizing it as persuasive communication. Adolescents find NA articles less credible and less ethical when they are informed about it. Moreover, results show that adolescents in general have a tendency to accept NA as a moral practice, while findings point to significant differences in responses moderated by country of origin. © 2019},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine marketing tactics used in the clinic websites of cross-border reproductive care (CBRC) providers and analyse what ethical implications exist when targeting the vulnerable consumer group of infertility sufferers. Design/methodology/approach: The sampling design was to collect clinic websites from regions known to be popular destinations for CBRC, and who were marketing directly to US-based consumers through their online websites. There were three stages of data collection: organic Google search that displayed Google AdWords of clinics who advertised; organic Google search results; and searching via the WhatClinic.com database for additional private clinics with websites. The websites were then audited for their marketing tactics according to the best practice guidelines from the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Findings: Through this analysis, it was confirmed that these clinics are attempting to establish their credibility and attract foreign consumers through their promised rates of success, years of experience and use of testimonials. In total, 32 of the 35 sites contained at least one factor considered misleading by ASRM guidelines, such as the publishing of inaccurate or non-transparent success rates, the use of sales promotions and guarantees often used in consumer products, or the use of misleading language. Out of the 24 sites that posted success rates, 17 of those rates would be considered deceptive by not clarifying the source of the numbers or by being so far from the global averages of 30 per cent. Research limitations/implications: Marketing practitioners have a specific responsibility to recognise vulnerable market segments; therefore this initial study seeks to add to the understanding of consumer vulnerability through an intersectional view of global reproductive service consumption. Practical implications: A global standard of marketing guidelines specific to CBRC clinics needs to be implemented across all regional/countries in order to communicate ethically, improve credibility, reputation and trust among consumer and international bodies. Counselling services need to be integrated within all assisted reproductive technology services. Service-country to home-country continued care protocols should be created for patients travelling home in order to collect data on CRBC experiences. Originality/value: This study contributes to the CBRC literature in providing new insights into current clinic marketing trends and highlights ethical implications to industry stakeholders. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Then, we use three case studies to discuss potential ethical pitfalls of such experiments, including involvement of political content, price discrimination, and advertising campaigns.

Often the advertising agency clients forget that the advertisement is going to reach the segments of users of different genders, who can perceive their message in a very different way, based on their ethical perception. The organizations have to learn not only what products are desired by the user, but also how to present them ethically in the advertising with regard to different segments of the customers.

The findings of the study revealed that Wasted Time, Leisure, Degree of Gratification, Self-Reliance, Centrality of Work, Hard Work, and Morality are not statistically significant to employee rewards and hours worked. The study recommends that: 1.) Private universities should embark on creating leisure periods for their faculty in order to increase their level of productivity; 2.) Private universities should continue to use reward system and increase promotion as a way of maintaining faculty loyalty. © 2015 AIBE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the Ethical Positioning Index (EPI), an innovative ranking scale based on the ethical issues in brand positioning. This paper is based on the core idea that ethics can be used as a product differentiator and can create a strategic advantage. Design/methodology/approach: Five basic elements of brand positioning, brand identity, brand image, brand personality, brand awareness, and brand communication, are blended with the three basic elements of ethics; beliefs, values, and symbols and customs. The EPI emerges from the established ethical brand positioning framework and the analysis from the conducted survey which was composed of brand positioning and ethics questions. Findings: Consumer driven weights have been obtained and a mathematical model has been proposed to evaluate the total score and finally the ranking of the brands. Research limitations/implications: The EPI parameters' weight will vary owing to the non-existence of universal ethics and hence subsequently every cohort will have its own weight. Practical implications: EPI will be an important tool from the managerial point of view as it serves as a step-by-step guide to compare the position of the brand in an integrated and ethical manner. Social implications: The EPI will bring a change in the ideology of the brands, making them employ more ethical perspectives in their branding, which will be highly welcomed by consumers and society. Originality/value: The role of ethics in brand positioning has been studied and blended to generate a novel-ranking scale (EPI). © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Advertisements are the first point of contact a marketer has with a prospective consumer. It is at this stage that a marketer gets an opportunity to leave an impression in the minds of a reader and to differentiate a reader from a prospective customer. Marketers achieve this objective with the help of two tools of advertising i.e. attractiveness cues and information cues. Given the limitation of time, space and financial resources marketers have been forced into a tradeoff between information cues and attractiveness cues. This tradeoff has given rise to skepticism in the minds of customers and policy makers concerning the balance between the two cues and resulting ethical issues. This paper aims to carry out a content analysis of advertisements in magazines in order to study this tradeoff between information and attractiveness cues in advertisements. To pursue the research objective, it was decided to collect data through content analysis of advertisements. To judge the level of informative and attractiveness cues in advertisements, classification by Resnik and Stern and Pollay along with imagery questions were used. The classification determines the level of advertising information based on 14 criteria or cues. The classification is an established baseline and has also been tested for reliability in other cultures. To collect data it was decided to use magazine advertisements as these are a preferred means for advertising OTC drugs. In order to select the sample various Indian and US magazines were reviewed. Indian magazines focusing entirely on health and women could not be found; therefore two popular women's magazines were chosen which discussed health topics. For interpreting the content of the advertisements two coders, who were trained in marketing research, were chosen. Data collection resulted in 170 unique advertisements across India and USA. The results of the study highlighted that, although both US and Indian OTC advertisements were trading off in favor of attractiveness cues, Indian advertisements were more imbalanced. Indian advertisements on an average have 4.83 attractiveness cues out of 6.60 cues per advertisements while US advertisements have 4.55 attractiveness cues out of 7.54 cues per advertisement. Indian advertisements not only have on an average fewer information cues, but also fared badly in terms of the type of cues. The US marketers were found to be more socially responsible in terms of advertisements ethics as compared to Indian marketers in the context of the OTC drugs industry. The study was limited to OTC drugs; a more detailed study should be carried out to compare advertising content by specific product categories. Difference in scope of magazines used in this study may have influenced the adequacy of sample, as profile of target customers in the two magazines was a little different. The results indicated that the Indian OTC advertisers needed to re-evaluate the industry standards and become more ethical and socially responsible to give the industry a global outlook and acceptance. The paper highlights the need for companies to adopt a proactive and socially responsible attitude and improve information content of Indian OTC advertisements as per international industry standards. The paper will be of value to corporate and social policy makers and also to marketers. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

College student participants (n=200) with and without sexual performance problems (SPP) were asked if they received, opened/read, and bought pornography from spam e-mail. Those with SPP had significantly greater percentages than those without SPP for receiving (93.3% versus 68.1%, p=0.042), opening/reading (66.7% versus 14.1%, p<0.001), and purchasing (46.7% versus 4.9%, p<0.001) pornography from spam e-mail. In the multivariate logistic regression analyses adjusting for demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity), Internet (Internet use, number spam e-mails received), and psychological (self-esteem, perceived stress, sexual performance attitudes) variables, those with SPP were significantly associated with opening/reading (OR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.05, 19.33) and purchasing (OR: 8.76, 95% CI: 1.78, 43.27) pornography from spam e-mail. Also, increased sexual performance attitudes were associated with opening/reading (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.54) and purchasing (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.62) pornography from spam e-mail. None of the other demographic, Internet, or psychological variables had any associations. Pornography spam e-mail is opened/read and purchased, especially among those with SPP. Targeting those with SPP with e-mail advertisements has ethical implications, in addition to the general ethical issue of sending spam e-mail. © Fogel and Shlivko, 2010.},

Results show that humour secures attention getting while disrupts message processing. Humour enhances message persuasiveness when the moderating variable need for cognition (NFC) is controlled. Participants with low NFC are easier to be persuaded by humorous commercials than participants with high NFC do. It is also found that repeated exposure to the same humorous commercial does not harm its persuasive effect. Male audiences regard humorous commercials as more persuasive while female audiences are the opposite. The study provides guidelines for advertisers/advertising practitioners who would like to employ humour in their communication at the same time it draws ethical concerns towards the increased application of entertainment-coated persuasion. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: In the current information age, when the attention spans of most people have become very short, marketers are facings serious challenges to grab the attention of their target audience effectively and fruitfully. From street corner to bedroom, virtually every perceivable location of human traces are littered with activity of marketers, whether they are small or large in scale or the recipients of their information understand the message properly. Studying consumers’ acceptance of the main ethical issues in communication, mainly in advertising, has recently been receiving much attention from scholars. Therefore, to grab the attention of people in the increasing competitive environment, advertisers have resorted to using what they feel can quickly attract the audience. For example, the attachment of attractive women with their physical natural endowments presented in explicit sexually appealing postures to products/services that have no linkage with women. These practices have raised some moral and ethical questions within the society. Therefore, this study aims to focus on discussing marketing communication through presenting women as a sexual object from the morality, ethics and religious perspectives. Design/methodology/approach: This is a descriptive study based on the systematic literature review. Initially, this paper discusses the ethical issues of using women and sexual appeals in the process of marketing communication, as well as the current level of practices in the industry. Then, it discusses the consequences and dimensions of the issues from different types of ethical grounds. Finally, it provides recommendations with the objective of finding a common ground from business and social perspectives. It also mentions the scopes of further research, which could lead the secular world to modify their moral values and come closer to the norms of other civilized societies. Findings: The position of the paper takes is that considering the negative effects of the prevalent advertising in society, the practice falls short of human moral values; as a result, it is considered unethical. Originality/value: This review paper examines the ethical implication of using women as marketing tools from the perspectives of morality, business and Islamic principles that will help business groups, as well as the whole religious community, especially Muslims. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore ethical issues related to pharmaceutical marketers’ social media efforts including the prevalence and forms of direct-to-consumer web 2.0 advertising (eDTCA) and corporate social responsibility (CSR) messages across social networking sites (SNSs). One goal is to determine if these eDTCA posts comply with draft guidelines issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of ten pharmaceutical marketers’ SNS posts documented the frequency and types of posts devoted to eDTCA, drug risks and benefits, CSR, and other purposes. Findings: eDTCA represents about 35 percent of all pharmaceutical firm SNS posts and primarily communicates help-seeking messages via Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. Firms also promote their ethical image through CSR-related posts. These posts primarily highlight employee-focussed and community-focussed initiatives. Analysis of consumer behavior in response to each post shows that eDTCA affects only liking of YouTube videos, but CSR increases behavior responses on all SNSs except LinkedIn. Social implications: Despite absence of final guidance, pharmaceutical marketers seem to abide by FDA draft social media guidance. In line with the FDA’s draft fair-balance regulations, almost all product-claim eDTCA posts state both benefit and risk information. Nevertheless, the FDA should issue final eDTCA guidance without delay consistent with traditional media direct-to-consumer advertising guidance. This should benefit consumers through consistency with their existing advertising literacy competencies. Originality/value: The study represents an initial attempt to document ethical issues in the current state-of-the-practice of pharmaceutical social media marketing related to eDTCA and CSR. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The use of social relationships as a promotional tool in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising has received limited attention despite relational impacts on illnesses and empirical evidence supporting social relationships’ positive influence with some patients. This content analysis provides insights into social relationship appeals’ use in DTC magazine ads for each drug-class category. Further, the current study introduces the concept of social anxiety appeals into the DTC advertising literature, which had previously focused more on fear appeals, such as the fear of pain. Social relationships appeared in 42.5% of the 421 DTC ads included in the sample. Social anxiety appeals appeared in 28.5% of ads with social relationships. Types of social relationships depicted (nonromantic, romantic, non-human pets or cartoon characters, and family) vary across drug-class categories. The current study affirms that DTC advertisers frequently appeal to the theoretical importance of relationships as an aid to improved health. It also raises ethical issues when neither the implied improvements in relationships nor decreased social anxiety are direct consequences of prescribed use of the advertised pharmaceutical. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {While e-commerce has grown rapidly in recent years, some of the practices associated with certain aspects of marketing on the Internet, such as pop-ups, cookies, and spam, have raised concerns on the part of Internet users. In this paper I examine the nature of these practices and what I take to be the underlying source of this concern. I argue that the ethical issues surrounding these Internet marketing techniques move us beyond the traditional treatment of the ethics of marketing and advertising found in discussions of business ethics previously. Rather, I show that the questions they raise ultimately turn upon questions of technique and the ways in which technologies can transform the fundamental means by which relationships are established and maintained within a social environment. I then argue that the techniques of e-commerce are indeed transforming the means by which businesses relate to consumers, and that this transformation is affecting the applicability of our previous ways of demarcating the imperatives determining the limits of accessibility between consumers and businesses. Properly addressing the ethical status of the techniques of e-marketing as such necessarily moves us to consider the changes that Internet commerce are having upon the norms that govern individuals in their relations with others. © Springer 2005.},

	abstract = {Purpose - This study aims to assesses the relative importance that Belgian consumers attach to different characteristics and marketing practices of ethically labelled coffee, i.e. type of ethical issue, label issuer, amount of information provided, distribution and promotion strategy and branding. Design/methodology/approach - Buying behaviour is studied by means of a web-based survey in a sample of 750 Belgian consumers, using conjoint analysis. Findings - Consumers attach greatest importance to the distribution strategy of ethically labelled coffee, followed by the type of ethical label, and the issuer of the label. Ethically labelled coffee should be available in ordinary supermarkets and be presented along with non-ethical coffee brands. Fair trade labelled coffee is by far the most preferred over eco- and bio-labels. European government labels, or labels issued by non-governmental organizations, are preferred over national (Belgian) government endorsed labels. Consumers prefer extra information on the package, in addition to a label. Out-of-shop promotion of the label and the type of brand are of minor importance. The results are similar across different socio-demographic groups. Practical implications - Implications for governments, NGOs, and manufacturers and distributors of ethically labelled coffee (and possibly other ethical products) are offered. Originality/value - The contribution of the study is that it measures the relative importance of factors that have previously been identified as relevant in a realistic multi-attribute preference-formation framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Increasing numbers of marketers are turning to the crowd—members of the public engaged with brands via the Internet—to develop marketing and advertising campaigns. Some marketers use social media to connect directly with customers, while others use crowdsourcing agencies to harness the power of crowd labor. As more members of the public become aware of creative crowdsourcing, they look to the media to understand more about it. As a result, it is important to examine how the media currently frame creative crowdsourcing to the public, particularly when numerous ethical issues about crowdsourcing have been identified (e.g. work is devalued as crowdworkers earn little money and no benefits for their work). This study examines media coverage of creative crowdsourcing to examine how benefits and challenges are presented. Informed by a framework developed by Swain (Understanding and communicating science: new agendas in communication, Routledge, London, pp 209–232, 2009), results indicate that most media coverage focuses solely on benefits to the industry: benefits to the ‘crowd’ are rarely discussed, yet drawbacks to the crowd are mentioned more frequently than drawbacks for the industry. This provides a skewed vision of what creative crowdsourcing is and may affect participation in the practice. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {The paper titled “The What, Why and How of Performance-Driven Funding in Sports Industry – Economics and Management of Sports Industry’s Competitive Strategy” focuses on the economic and managerial opportunities, challenges and future perspectives of the spectacular ascension of the sports industry. First of all, the work focuses on emphasising three key elements, the “what”, “why” and “how” that defines and supports this industry’s role, with a clear focus on performance-driven and performance-enhancing factors that arise in today’s society. Second of all, the work relies on the sports industry’s economic and managerial attributes capable to generate competition, and to enable and enhance its benefits on the long run. Third of all, the work bases its structure on the idea that the sports industry focuses itself, like any other type of industry, on key triggers such as profit, net worth, growth, market quota, investments, recent results and potential opportunities, importance of brand, fierce fully competition, and sports marketing, being in essence a segmented market largely based on enhanced revenues, strongly dependent on governmental and investors’ money infusions, eager to attract new customers and willing to attract more and more attention, even though its major trends and challenges come from the fact that it is an industry “full of passion”. In addition, the research paper stresses the connections that exist between elements such as, for example, gross domestic product (G.D.P.) and sports’ investments, governmental influence and policy in sports, advertising and media and sports’ investments, health and tourism sectors and sports industry. However, specialists believe that particularly due to the sports industry’s diversity and segmentation, it was not sufficiently enough explored and not profoundly enough valued at its true capacity and potential in numerous countries, such as India, China and Turkey, for example, where the sports market represents a huge untapped opportunity. In general lines, the sports industry confronts itself with numerous moral and ethical issues, mainly because it is not an independent sector; on the contrary, being a mass market, the activities that take place in this industry closely affect other sectors of the society, such as marketing, health and tourism, being interesting and aggressive enough to constantly attract customers and investors. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association IBIMA.

We show that fast disclaimers greatly reduce consumer comprehension of product risks and benefits, creating implications for social responsibility. In addition, across two studies, we found that disclaimer speed and brand familiarity interact to predict brand trust and purchase intention, and that brand trust mediated the interactive effect of brand familiarity and disclaimer speed on purchase intention. Our results indicate that fast disclaimers actually reduce brand trust and purchase intention for unfamiliar brands, suggesting that there are both economic and social responsibility reasons to use less rapid disclaimers for unfamiliar brands. Conversely, disclaimer speed had no negative effects on brand trust and purchase intention for highly familiar brands, presenting ethical tensions between economic interests (e.g., an efficient use of advertisement time) and social responsibility. We discuss the implications of our framework for advertising ethics, for corporate social performance, and for corporate social responsibility. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Hotel directors and especially the marketers, face ethical challenges on a daily basis. Nonetheless very few tend to consider some aspects of their daily operations to be issues relating to ethics at all. In the past it has been commonplace for many hotels to conduct their operations in whichever way, often to the detriment of consumers and this trend continues to an extent today. Greater market penetration is vital for a hotel as the depth of sales of a product or service in a particular market enhances the bottom-line and invariably affects sustainability. Certain hotels consider ethics to be a restraint on their profitability. Such operations consider increased revenues and ethics to be contrarywise. In reality however, espousing ethical practices may in the short term decrease profits, but in the long-run a hotel's profitability will increase due to the notion that once a hotel has a positive ethical practice reputation it gains a strategic competitive advantage. Many hotels are not looking at the consequences of their unethical actions in aspects such as advertising. There should however be an approach to advertising in which hotels strive to reach consumers in an honest way without subjectively embellishing and making blatant untruths about their offerings. Marketing is intrinsically linked to a variety of ethical issues that require serious consideration and a sense of moral idealism in which universal consumer rights are not flouted, and utilitarianism in which consequences of actions are careful mapped out so that 'the greatest good for the greatest number' can be realised after assessment of the costs and benefits of the desired ethical marketing. Hotel operations cannot forever hide behind the concept caveat emptor or 'buyer beware' and are called upon to be proactively ethical as matter of course in all dealings but especially in marketing. © 2018 AJHTL.},

If students are able to increase their ethical recognition abilities and likelihood to behave consistently after extended exposure to ethics instruction, then this practice may well help to address some of the negative activities plaguing the industry.

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between ethical climate and facets of job satisfaction among organizational buyers. Design/methodology/approach – This research is an empirical study. Data are collected from the industrial buyers using online panel. The INDSALES scale, the scale developed to measure job satisfaction of boundary spanners, was used to measure the job satisfaction. Partial least squares, a components-based structural equation modeling approach, was employed to conduct data analysis. Findings – The key finding was that buyer’s organizational policy mediates the relationship between buyers’ perception of ethical climate and buyers’ satisfaction with pay and promotion as well as satisfaction with coworkers and supervisors. The findings also show that work satisfaction can be achieved at different levels based on particular components associated to the work environment. Practical implications – The role of ethical climate in this study offers insights into managers who constantly observe lower levels of job satisfaction among their buying team. Given that companies specify rules and regulations as a way to standardize employee behaviors and prevent unethical practices, managers must ensure that such codes specifically address issue pertaining to compensation, supervision and promotion. Originality/value – Most of the previous studies in the business-to-business boundary spanning literature address ethical climate primarily from the salesperson’s perspective. Ethical issues relating to organizational buyers in business-to-business setting has largely gone underexplored. This research is one of the few studies that focus on industrial buyers and ethical issues. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In contrast, using Hofstede's classification to select representative collectivist countries in high potential regions and conducting surveys of 308 physicians in Greece, the United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan, this research investigates physician attitudes towards the value of drug manufacturers' physician- and consumer-targeted communication strategies. The analysis reveals that physicians are satisfied with physician-targeted communication strategies and greatly value two-way interactive approaches, though they have significantly differing attitudes across cultures towards the likely impacts of DTC advertising, with Greek physicians the most opposed. They generally support unbranded disease awareness campaigns though. The research findings thus suggest that planned value creation for manufacturers and consumers through DTC advertising conflicts with the value delivery for the intermediary physician, which delays the expansion of this advertising policy. © 2011 Westburn Publishers Ltd.},

Native ads typically blend with their surrounding context, stem from sources or placements that do not signal advertising, lack overtly persuasive or sales-focused messaging, and have less clear material outcomes. Such characteristics raise ethical concerns because native ads are more difficult for consumers to identify and because they challenge concepts that are central to current deceptive advertising policy. Native advertising is a Federal Trade Commission enforcement priority, and the agency has developed guidelines for this new ad form. However, the unique characteristics of native advertising likely require novel approaches to protect consumers. In this article, the authors trace the evolution of regulation relevant to native advertising. They identify shortcomings and propose remedies that the Federal Trade Commission or industry could adopt to prevent consumer harm, detect infractions, and enforce its regulations. The authors also develop an agenda for future research needed to more fully inform public policy and industry response in this arena. © American Marketing Association 2018.},

The difficulty of advertising to Millennials has also prompted the use of unbranded cause advertising, to increase awareness of issues championed by the brand, without triggering defensive persuasion-coping strategies. Chipotle combined both these trends when it produced a relatively unbranded piece of branded entertainment, Farmed and Dangerous, a four-episode sitcom that humorously dramatized the ethical issues raised by industrial farming. When the series ran on Hulu, an online television network, it increased sales for the Chipotle brand and won awards for its creators. This study reports a classic pre/post experimental design, to show how exposure to this unbranded entertainment increased purchase intention by changing beliefs about ethical issues related to the environment, nutrition, and gene technology. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

It also investigates upon the relative significance of these factors in predicting the preference to buy and recommend eco-friendly cosmetics and beauty care products to others. Design/methodology/approach - The paper applies the data reduction technique by using exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 150 female consumers and condenses a set of 35 attributes into a list of eight comprehensible factors influencing the purchasing patterns of eco-friendly and beauty care products among females in Mauritius. Multiple regression analysis was also conducted to investigate upon the importance of the eight dimensions in influencing the behavioural intentions of females to purchase eco-friendly products and their likeliness to engage in referral for eco-friendly products. Findings - The factor analysis identified that the purchasing patterns for eco-friendly cosmetics and beauty care products is influenced by a combination of eight factors namely: "women lifestyles, self-image health and economic considerations", "ethical consumerism among females", "pharmacological essence of green cosmetics and beauty care products", "visual appeal and physical cues in cosmetic stores", "price-conscious decisions and effective promotion", "belief on ethical claims in green messages", "brand image and usage experience" and "sales representatives and social influences". The results of the regression analysis have also suggested that the behavioural intention and referral of female customers is primarily derived from one predictor factor related to "women lifestyles, self-image, health and economic conditions". Practical implications - In terms of marketing strategies, cosmetic and beauty care organisations should promote greater ethical concerns among female customers through effective green advertising messages. Greater emphasis should be placed on the pharmacological essence of green advertising. Cosmetic executives should also focus on health-related benefits while marketing cosmetics and beauty care products. Originality/value - The paper aims to fill up the significant gap in the literature on purchasing patterns for eco-friendly cosmetics and beauty care products among female customers. This study remains one of few research work designed to address different factors influencing the purchasing patterns for green cosmetics and beauty care products in the context of developing countries such as Mauritius.

Similarly, the pros and cons associated with this entire sector tend to get lumped together, such that individuals and groups often situate themselves as either "pro-" or "anti-" biotechnology as a whole. But different biotechnologies and their particular application context pose very different challenges for ethical corporate decision-making. Even within a single product category, different specialty products can pose strikingly different ethical challenges. In this paper, we focus on the single over-arching category of "genetic testing" and compare tests for disease susceptibility and drug response. We highlight the diversity of ethical challenges - grouped under the broad categories of "truth in advertising" and "protecting intellectual property" - raised by the commercialization and marketing of these technologies. By examining social and technical differences between genetic tests, and the associated corporate ethics challenges posed by their commercialization, our intent is to contribute to the nascent business ethics literature examining issues raised by the development and marketing of genetic tests. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Future research needs to focus on more empirical studies, television DTCA, online and emerging media DTCA, new and improved measures, ethical issues and regulations, diverse countries, and nurse and pharmacist attitudes towards DTCA. – The primary contribution of this paper is a thorough understanding of the state-of-the-art in research on DTCA and future research directions. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

	abstract = {Neuromarketing is an emerging field which connects disciplines such as psychology, science, neurology, marketing, and neuroscience with economics. The main goal of neuromarketing is to explore how the brain is physiologically affected by various marketing strategies and advertising tools. The article discussed various neuromarketing techniques and their applications and aimed to examine the common ethical concerns of neuromarketing, emphasizing on the potential threats and risks to the consumers. A meta - analysis approach was used to capture the content of appropriate literatures and content analysis was done to support the views. As examined in the paper, neuromarketing studies the different emotions that are associated with human decision making and uses this information to improve the effectiveness of marketing. The benefits of this study can be taken to the marketing domain. This paper identified and addressed the qualitative impact of neuromarketing in different fields of advertisements and promotions. It also provided the metadata for future researchers to think about the universal code of ethics and objectives that can be implemented to promote the development of research in neuromarketing in a more positive light. © 2019, Associated Management Consultants Pvt.

	abstract = {Recent revelations concerning data firm Cambridge Analytica’s illegitimate use of the data of millions of Facebook users highlights the ethical and, relatedly, legal issues arising from the use of machine learning techniques. Cambridge Analytica is, or was – the revelations brought about its demise - a firm that used machine learning processes to try to influence elections in the US and elsewhere by, for instance, targeting ‘vulnerable’ voters in marginal seats with political advertising. Of course, there is nothing new about political candidates and parties employing firms to engage in political advertising on their behalf, but if a data firm has access to the personal information of millions of voters, and is skilled in the use of machine learning techniques, then it can develop detailed, fine-grained voter profiles that enable political actors to reach a whole new level of manipulative influence over voters. My focus in this paper is not with the highly publicised ethical and legal issues arising from Cambridge Analytic’s activities but rather with some important ethical issues arising from the use of machine learning techniques that have not received the attention and analysis that they deserve. I focus on three areas in which machine learning techniques are used or, it is claimed, should be used, and which give rise to problems at the interface of law and ethics (or law and morality, I use the terms “ethics” and “morality” interchangeably). The three areas are profiling and predictive policing (Saunders et al. 2016), legal adjudication (Zeleznikow, 2017), and machines’ compliance with legally enshrined moral principles (Arkin 2010). I note that here, as elsewhere, new and emerging technologies are developing rapidly making it difficult to predict what might or might not be able to be achieved in the future. For this reason, I have adopted the conservative stance of restricting my ethical analysis to existing machine learning techniques and applications rather than those that are the object of speculation or even informed extrapolation (Mittelstadt et al. 2015). This has the consequence that what I might regard as a limitation of machine learning techniques, e.g. in respect of predicting novel outcomes or of accommodating moral principles, might be thought by others to be merely a limitation of currently available techniques. After all, has not the history of AI recently shown the naysayers to have been proved wrong? Certainly, AI has seen some impressive results, including the construction of computers that can defeat human experts in complex games, such as chess and Go (Silver et al. 2017), and others that can do a better job than human medical experts at identifying the malignancy of moles and the like (Esteva et al. 2017). However, since by definition future machine learning techniques and applications are not yet with us the general claim that current limitations will be overcome cannot at this time be confirmed or disconfirmed on the basis of empirical evidence. © 2019 Miller.

The marketing of products deemed "socially questionable" or "sinful" (like tobacco and alcohol) has long been recognized as posing special ethical challenges (Kotler, P. and S. Levy: 1971, Harvard Business Review 49, 74-80; Davidson, D. K: 1996, Selling Sin: The Marketing of Socially Unacceptable Products (Quorum Press, Westport). We contend that marketers should consider securities (i.e. common stock, options) in a similar vein, as a potentially dangerous product. Given the inherent volatility of equity prices, responsible marketers need to exercise caution and restraint in promoting securities. We evaluate whether the NYSE's current guidelines adequately encourage ethical marketing practices and deter unethical ones. Using recent examples of controversial brokerage advertisements, we expose weaknesses in the Exchange's vague injunction that members not "mislead" reasonable people by making "exaggerated claims" in their communications. From a moral perspective, we find it troublesome that intentionality need not be present for a promotion to be considered misleading. Also problematic is the continued invocation of the reasonable person standard to judge the propriety of advertisements. We close with some thoughts on improving the quality of securities marketing. We suggest that the NYSE, in the interests of fostering higher ethical behavior among member marketers, may need to revive a marketing code of conduct prevalent on Wall Street in an earlier era. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The second objective is to determine which of these ideologies exert the greatest influence on consumer ethical beliefs and the third objective is to discover whether Malaysian consumers have evolved in their ethical stance over the last ten years. The dependent variable in this research is the recently modified consumer ethics scale developed by Vitell and Muncy (2005). An online survey was adopted as data collection method as it was inexpensive, fast and could ensure high response rates. However it has several limitations such as the possible non-representativeness of Internet respondents to the Malaysian population and higher non-response error. The results indicated that idealism exerted the greatest influence on all the four dimensions of consumer ethics. It was also revealed that Malaysian consumers had evolved over the past ten years in their moral ideology: From relativism to idealism.},

Drawing on Bourdieu's theory of practice, this paper examines how the perceptions, practices, and discourses of advertising practitioners in the Middle East and North Africa influence the advertising field's habitus and doxa. It demonstrates that understanding ethical problems is enhanced by examining them as macro, meso, and micro phenomena. However, that is not enough. Understanding how factors at the three levels interrelate, interact, and reinforce one another is critical to understanding the habitus. Underlying biases that shape the doxa can be explained by ideas central to behavioral ethics. A better understanding of the forces that shape the habitus and doxa with respect to ethics is key to moving toward a culture that encourages ethical advertising practices. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.},

Using a pseudo-product-harm crisis event that involved two competing firms, this research examines how consumer sentiments about the two firms evolved in response to the crisis. Our analyses show that while both firms suffered, the damage to the offending firm (which spread fake news to cause the crisis) was more detrimental, in terms of advertising effectiveness and negative news publicity, than that to the victim firm (which suffered from the false claim). Our study indicates that, even apart from ethical concerns, the false claim about the victim firm was not an effective business strategy to increase the offending firm’s performance. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Without clear indication of the site ownership, these websites look like non-advertising health information websites. Consumers’ responses to pharmaceutical company-sponsored disease information websites were examined in comparison to their responses to typical direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug brand websites.

Study subjects were randomly assigned to one of three live websites: pharmaceutical company-sponsored disease information website; DTC brand website with a high level of trust cues; and DTC brand website with a low level of trust cues. After viewing the assigned websites, participants completed an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included measurements for perceived website trust, attitude toward the website, intention to use information, perceived importance of prescription drug information, perceived health, prescription drug use, disposition to trust, prior experience with the website and demographic information. Findings – The pharmaceutical company-sponsored disease information website generated higher website trust and more positive attitude and information use intention than the DTC drug brand websites. The results suggest that company-sponsored disease information websites may present some ethical issues related to website identity information transparency, which seems to inhibit consumers’ persuasion knowledge activation and proper coping responses. Because such websites look like non-advertising health information websites, consumers tend to evaluate them more positively and place higher trust in them than typical DTC drug brand websites with clear advertiser identification. Originality/value – This is the first study examining pharmaceutical company-sponsored disease information websites, a relatively new form of covert DTC online advertising with potential ethical concerns due to the site identity transparency issues. This study’s findings suggest that consumers are likely to be more trusting and receptive of information presented in websites taking the form of a non-advertising health information website than in DTC brand websites. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The article deals with the influence of organizational ethics program (EP) components on managerial ethical behavior. The main aim was to establish which EP components are perceived as valuable and useful to foster the ethical behavior of managers. Moreover, we also aimed to investigate the role of ethics training in this context and to explore whether it can potentially increase managers’ trust in EP components as effective tools for the promotion of ethical behavior. The article advances the EP theory in several ways. It offers novel insights into both business ethics and EP development in the specific cultural and social circumstances of a former socialist country in the Central and Eastern European region, Slovakia. It shows that codes of ethics and related reporting and control mechanisms are perceived as the most effective EP components to shape managerial ethical behavior. Furthermore, based on empirical evidence, and to some extent contrary to prior theory, the article unveils three EP functions, namely the ‘compliance with group norms,’ the ‘ethics education through collective discussion,’ and the ‘counselling and resolving of ethical issues’ at workplace. In addition, the article shows that ethics trainings can help to boost the trust of managers toward EP components and might be conceptualized as a precursor for an effectively functioning EP. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The ethics of advertising to children has been identified as one of the most important topics worthy of academic research in the marketing field. A fast growing advertising technique is product placement, and its use in children's films is becoming more and more common. The limited evidence existing suggests that product placements are especially potent in their effects upon children. Yet regulations regarding placements targeted at children are virtually non-existent, with advertising guidelines suggesting that it remains the prime responsibility of the parents to provide guidance for children. This study measured the ethical evaluations of parents in the UK and Canada regarding product placements in children's films. After exposing parents to a four-type typology of product placements, results show that explicit placements of ethically charged products were perceived as the most unethical type of placements. Parents in the UK were more sensitive to the use of the technique and there was a significant difference in relativism between the two groups. Both sets of respondents would like to see more regulation on the use of placements, especially placements of alcohol, tobacco and fast foods. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This article will differ from most in the field by examining marketing practices that are generally truthful, but deceive almost everyone. These practices do not fool just small select groups, but are fooling those usually assumed to be rational. For example, we love "free" merchandise so much that we are willing to irrationally settle for less to get the free product. Behavioral economists and psychologists are proving that, as Dan Ariely puts it, most all of us are "Predictably Irrational." Is it wrong for marketers to take advantage of the mass's foibles as it is wrong to take advantage of children? The article will look at some of the behavioral economists' data, how that data affects the rational and ignorant person standards of marketing, and suggest the reflective rational person standard as a way to morally evaluate marketing techniques given this new data. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To date, the cultural and societal effects of controversial advertising have been insufficiently considered. This study aims to investigate how advertising that uses violent representations of women transgresses the taboo of gender-based violence. Design/methodology/approach: This study encompasses a visual analysis of the subject positions of women in five violent advertising representations and a critical discourse analysis of the defensive statements provided by the client organisations subsequent to the public outrage generated by the campaigns. Findings: The authors identify taboo transgression in the Tease, Piece of Meat and Conquered subject positions, wherein women are represented as suggestive, dehumanised and submissive. Client organisations seek to defend these taboo transgressions through the use of three discursive strategies – subverting interpretations, making authority claims and denying responsibility – which legitimise the control of the organisations but simultaneously work to obscure the power relations at play. Practical implications: The representational authority that advertisers hold as cultural intermediaries in society highlights the need for greater consideration of the ethical responsibilities in producing controversial advertisements, especially those which undermine the status of women. Social implications: Controversial advertising that transgresses the taboo of violence against women reinforces gender norms and promotes ambiguous and adverse understandings of women’s subjectivities by introducing pollution and disorder to gender politics. Originality/value: This paper critically assesses the societal implications of controversial advertising practices, thus moving away from the extant focus on managerial implications. Through a conceptualisation of controversial advertising as transgressing taboo boundaries, the authors highlight how advertising plays an important role in shifting these boundaries whereby taboos come to be understood as generative and evolving. However, this carries moral implications which may have damaging societal effects. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Data were collected by interviewing a total number of 400 respondents chosen by using simple random sampling method from four areas in Klang Valley. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the information of a factor that affect consumers’ attitude. FCQ is used in this study to determine the food choice factors that influence consumer’S attitude. The results indicated that most of the factors in FCQ: sensory appeal (r=0.115 p<0.022), natural content (r=0.202, p<0.000), health (r=0.257, p< 0.000), ethical concern (r=0.169, p< 0.001), body weight control (r=0.167, p< 0.001) convenience (r=0.185, p<0.000), mood (r=0.186, p<0.000), and price (r=0.168, p<0.001) have a significant positive relationship with green food attitude except familiarity. Multiple linear regression analysis found that health is the most significant factors more likely to affect consumers’ attitude towards green food with the value of 0.009. It can be concluded that health contributes in encouraging consumers to consume green food; and by referring to this relationship, it can also be presumed that green food consumption might improve consumer health well-being, including a positive change in their consumption. Future research should focus on a similar study with an extended scope to all states in Malaysia.

The promotion of some standpoints in ethical issues may be socially harmful, and even our decisions as to which issues we label as “ethical” may have unintended and potentially harmful social consequences. It can be argued that ethicists have an obligation to make positive contributions to society, but the practical implications of such an obligation are not easily identified.

Focusing on the French cultural context, this paper analyses whether these topics are still considered taboo in our society. We use the concept of taboo as studied in ethnology and psychoanalysis, which makes the reticence of consumers easier to understand and aids the study of taboos in relation to cultural context. We analyse the use of taboos in advertising, reviewing the literature on the impact of the use of death and sex in advertising, and relating it to ethical issues and cultural aspects. We then present a survey analysing whether French consumers find it acceptable to present taboos in advertising and identifying which individual characteristics affect attitudes towards taboos in advertising. Women and seniors are particularly hostile to sex and death in advertising, while young people find these themes more acceptable. The general attitude towards advertising also appears to have a strong impact on attitudes. We draw managerial implications from these results. © 2006 Advertising Association.},

In this paper, we examine to what extent the media treat their advertisers favorably, providing these advertisers' products extra visibility in supposedly neutral editorial content. Empirically, we model the determinant of media coverage of Italian fashion products in an extended dataset of consumer magazines in Italy, France, Germany, UK, and the USA. Research findings show that advertising is an important determinant of product placements in editorial content, and this result is consistent across countries and publishers. Our results imply that resource-rich advertisers engaging in compensatory advertising (that is, advertising investments that compensate poor product quality) might bias media coverage in their favor. Consumers will consequently be exposed twice to favorable messages about those products, in both advertisements and media content, resulting in higher purchases and reduced consumer welfare. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Neuromanagement is an emerging interdisciplinary subject that intersects neuroscience and social science. It has spawned new insights in multiple cutting-edge fields, such as consumer neuroscience, neuromarketing, neuroIS, and organizational neuroscience, thereby promoting the paradigm of management science from subjective to objective. Among these fields, consumer neuroscience can better understand consumer behavior and the motivations behind it. This article reviews the latest progresses pertaining to consumer behavior prediction in the perspective of consumer neuroscience. Specifically, it summarizes how neuroscience can be implemented in forecasting consumer behavior, as well as limitations and future research potentials. The article sets out from a brief introduction of the theoretically basis of consumer behavior prediction - the discovery of neural correlates that relates to consumer behavior. For example, the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are related to “reward”; the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is related to “subjective value”; and the mesencephalic limbic system is closely related to individual value perception. These findings unveil the neural “black box” behind consumer behavior, thereby laying a solid foundation for consumer behavior prediction. Consequently, they shed lights on the neural indicators that relate to consumer behavior, which help to interpret consumer behavior more accurately. Moreover, they also reveal that neural data can be the viable predictor for consumers' individual and market behaviors. Thus, consumer neuroscience not only enriches the decision theory, but also promotes the application of theory. Next, the article moves on to illustrate the methods in consumer behavior prediction with traditional methods and neuroscience tools. Traditional methods include qualitative methods like interviews and focus groups, quantitative methods like surveys, experimental studies, big data and artificial intelligence. Neuroscience tools include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), eye tracking, and some physiological and biological metrics like skin electrical response, heart rate, respiratory rate, etc. Among them, fMRI and fNIRS can locate brain regions related to specific functions; EEG records cortical potential when engaged in specific tasks; eye tracking is mainly used to record the eye movement; skin electrical response, heart rate, and respiratory rate can reflect the level of affect and emotion. Compared with traditional methods, neuroscience tools complement their alternatives such as predicting with laboratory behavioral data and show superiority to predict the overall market consumption. Then, this article demonstrates the recent trends of consumer behavior prediction research based on consumer neuroscience perspective. With the rapid development of consumer neuroscience, the research trend of consumer behavior prediction emerged and fluctuated in the last decade. Currently, it pioneers in consumer neuroscience. We summarize 18 representative researches regarding to their research tools, topics, measurement indicators, published journals, and then detail the research status of predicting consumer behavior. In related researches, fMRI predicts for consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference, product selection and advertising performance. It usually applies to occasions where the brain area has been clearly associated with specific behaviors; EEG is mostly used to predict consumer behavior at individual and market level in terms of experience preference and product selection. It applies to occasions where the stimuli is time-dynamic (e.g., video ads, movies, TV programs, etc.); eye tracking is mostly used to predict product selection behavior when studying consumer behavior related to visual attention; and other neuroscience tools for consumer behavior predication is also introduced. Lastly, this article points out the limitations in this vein of research based on the summary of previous studies. It states that a lack of specific cognitive indicators to predict consumer behavior, rare measure in real scenes, ethical issues need further discussion. In particular, domestic research is in its infancy and still has a large space for development. Then we put forward the directions that need to be broken in the future based on the current bottlenecks. (1) Combine multi-modal data to enrich unique indicators for predicting consumer behavior; (2) Predict consumer behavior from multiple stages of purchase decisions based on real-life needs; (3) Optimize data collection and analysis methods to improve the external validity; (4) Conduct cross-cultural research to reveal consumption forecast in domestic context. The rapid growth of neuroscience tools ushers in an era of consumer neuroscience. Consumer neuroscience researches are then equipped with more objective metrics to advance research in marketing researches. It supplements the earlier controversial researches and provides unlimited possibilities for the future development. In the future, the strand of consumer neuroscience will be closely integrated with emerging disciplines such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to develop richer research fields, attract more professional researchers, and apply more humane research tools, thereby providing more theoretical and pragmatic values for consumer behavior research. © 2020.

	abstract = {Purpose - To explore how a "harm chain" analysis could identify and address stakeholders' concerns about direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines (DTCA). Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the development of stakeholder theory before exploring and discussing the tension between normative and instrumental logic. The authors adopt a utilitarian perspective, which they use to identify the range of stakeholders involved with or affected by DTCA. Findings - A "harm chain" analysis identifies common concerns held by stakeholders; these include disquiet over the quality of information provided via DTCA and possible derogation of doctors' role as prescribers. The paper outlines prescriptive advertising guidelines that could address these issues, but notes that failure to achieve a satisfactory reduction in harm potential may result in a ban on DTCA. Research limitations/implications - Although a utilitarian norm will not satisfy all stakeholders' interests, the authors believe that it will produce the greatest reduction in harm, as well as maximising the benefits that can result from DTCA. The conclusions imply the need for independent monitoring of DTCA's effects on stakeholder groups to ensure that regulations governing this advertising are broadly based. Practical implications - The authors suggest changes to DTCA regulation, specifically the introduction of a "fair balance" criterion and a statement explicitly recognising doctors' role in determining appropriate treatments. Originality/value - Although the debate over DTCA has been well documented, this paper represents the first attempt to use stakeholder theory to explore the ethical issues associated with this advertising. The analysis produces a decision-making model that the authors recommend should guide future policy decisions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically tested the proposed hypotheses using the structural equation modelling using a sample of 399 blog users. Findings: The need for cognition, perceived interactivity and perceived credibility of blogs has been found to directly influence consumers’ attitude towards blogs. Innovativeness has been found to have a weak negative link with the attitude towards blogs. Blog users were more favourable towards the sponsored posts if the blogs were more interactive. Attitude towards blogs has been found to mediate the relationship between users’ perceived interactivity and their avoidance of the sponsored posts and also between perceived credibility and avoidance of the sponsored posts on blogs. The most significant finding of this study is that the positive attitude towards a blog results in a higher avoidance of the sponsored posts. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on the sponsored posts on blogs. It does not look at other forms of advertising on blogs such as banner ads, or other forms of consumer-generated content. Practical implications: Marketers and bloggers should carefully consider the suitability of the sponsored posts on blogs as they risk alienating the regular users of the blogs. Sponsored posts which are perceived as honest reviews (as opposed to paid advertorials) might be more acceptable to blog users. Social implications: This study highlights the importance of credibility of bloggers to blog users. There are some serious ethical issues related to the sponsored posts which have not been discussed here but need to be examined further. Originality/value: This study represents one of the first attempts to conceptualise and empirically examine how blog users engage with customer-generated advertising – sponsored posts. It contributes to marketing literature by enhancing the understanding of how consumers perceive consumer-generated content and more specifically, with regard to consumer attitudes towards online consumer-generated advertising.

	abstract = {The paper investigates the ethical decisions of Millennials, who are not only part of an expanding cohort of the workforce, but also represent potential future managers with a growing influence on work practices and employment relationships. In the conceptual model, we propose that three ethical frames of reference, represented by perceived organisational ethics, perceived employee ethics and reflective moral attentiveness, antecede ethical judgements, which further influence the ethical intentions of Millennials. Using structural equation modelling, we test the model for three different business ethics scenarios: paying a consulting fee, dumping hazardous waste, and running an offensive advertising campaign. The findings confirm the link between ethical judgements and intentions across the board, while the influence of the ethical frames of reference varies among the scenarios. We propose that the differences in the predictive ability of the ethical frames of reference depend on the nature of the ethical issue, which holds important implications for today's managers in their attempts to encourage ethical behaviour of Millennial employees. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, cause-related marketing (CRM) has become a popular and unique promotional tool for brands. Academic research indicates outcomes of such campaigns are generally positive for all stakeholders. Consumers feel they are making a difference, firms benefit from improved public image and increased sales, and the cause or nonprofit organization receives increased publicity and funding. However, there are ethical issues involved when linking a firm with a nonprofit organization as well as potential negatives (Smith and Stodghill 1994; Andreasan 1996; Meyer 1999; Polonsky and Wood 2001). An exploratory research study was undertaken to understand the impact of the structural elements of cause-related marketing campaigns, including how the donation is quantified, the size of the donation relative to the price of the product, the presence of donation deadlines and caps, and the level of promotion used to publicize the campaign. Findings suggest that the structural elements of cause-related marketing campaigns do influence consumers' perceptions of the campaigns. Based on these results, implications for CRM campaign managers and future research ideas are provided. This information will help practitioners, including marketing managers, advertising managers and advertising creative professionals to design the most effective communication tactics for a cause-related marketing campaign. © The Haworth Press, Inc.

To address this concern, we look at the consumer's ethical efficacy toward native ads and we compare native ads (such as in-feed and advertorial) to banner ads. Results confirm that consumers trust native ads more than banner ads. Moreover, we uncover that consumers ethical efficacy (i.e., confidence in ethical decision making) affects their intention to share native ads through eWOM. However, consumer individual differences influence intention to share content online and trust in the native ads. We study the moderating effects of salience, using the fashion context, and its influence on ad trust and willingness to share through eWOM.

	abstract = {The gradual crowding out of singleton and small team science by large team endeavors is challenging key features of research culture. It is therefore important for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual scientist’s ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this reflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in academic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the system; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders demonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid conflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to show how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of particular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the mentor–mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics across scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational complexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team heterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our expository analysis provides a survey of ethical issues in team settings to inform science ethics education and science policy. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

There is a lack of fair and just treatment of women in selection, assignment and promotion processes, as well as a lack of virtue shown by business leaders in not upholding the principle of assigning comparable women and men equally to positions in management and postings abroad. Female professionals, however, initiate their own expatriation more often than they are assigned abroad by their company, and usually as often as men self-expatriate. What causes women to self-initiate expatriation? Women's proactivity, in part an attempt to redress the disadvantage they face in managerial career advancement, appears influential, as are career and family motivations. Indeed, during expatriation, women fare well in their career and they repatriate only at the same rate as men. Compared with men, however, women repatriate less often for career than for family reasons. On their return, despite their international experience, women do not gain as much of a financial return on their investment in self-expatriation as do men, suggesting that women may suffer unfair, non-meritorious treatment at home. Overall, self-initiated expatriation provides a new, gendered, social context for researching women's career advancement. The ethical issues associated with women's self-expatriation - a lack of fairness and justice in selection, assignment and promotion decisions, and a lack of virtue shown by business leaders in upholding fair and just human resource decisions by gender - suggest practical avenues to resolve these issues. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This case has a difficulty level of three to four and is best utilized in higher-level undergraduate or graduate courses. This case is designed to be taught in one and a half class hours with students having two hours of out-ofclass preparation. CASE SYNOPSIS: EHarmony is an online dating company that was started in 2000, under the premise that it matched couples scientifically on "29 dimensions of compatibility." Unlike other dating sites, eHarmony focuses specifically on creating lifelong "matches" and has marketed the company accordingly. Originally, eHarmony was based on strong Christian principles, using the number of marriages produced from the site as a marketing tactic. However, competition and a more mature market have led the company to expand in order to survive and still hold a competitive advantage. Now, it has gone after the secular market in order to compete with the largest online dating company, Match.com. In trying to expand, however, eHarmony has made several mistakes. First, eHarmony has excluded gays and lesbians and been sued for doing so. They eventually settled out of court and agreed to provide gays and lesbians with a separate service for matching. Furthermore, other lawsuits allege that eHarmony's matching system is not scientific and allows online predators and scam artists to connect with unknowing singles. That case is still in the court system. Another way that eHarmony has tried to expand is by creating specific sites for different countries. In Britain, it created a new method of matching for British singles, but for its Canadian and Australian sites, eHarmony utilized the same system as in the United States. Ignoring the sociological differences could be extremely detrimental to the company as a whole. Finally, eHarmony has chosen to advertise in traditional ways, utilizing television and print advertisements instead of advertising online or creating applications for mobile devices. In Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies, Volume 18, Number 2, 2012 doing so, eHarmony has missed out on a large part of the market - the younger generation that is constantly on the go and rely on mobile devices and computers rather than television and print.},

Therefore, we start by recalling some of the ethical problems that confront the marketing profession. On this basis, we argue for more emphasis on basic ethical principles to protect the autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability of human persons and of different stakeholder groups. However, such general concerns must be accomplished with a framework for decision-making by marketers with regard to concrete priorities in the daily work of marketing and advertising in the digital environment. In order to cope with this need for a decision-making frame we propose a formal theory of values that can be the basis for a concrete approach to values in e-marketing. Such a formal theory of the value realm (Hartman, 1967) can be used to make an overview of different kinds of ethical challenges firms face when implementing e-marketing and e-advertising. Eighteen value types and nine value levels, we argue, can be used as a frame with the intent to illustrate ethical dilemmas in e-busines. Copyright © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Modern manner of advertising now causes several ethical issues in marketing trend. Surrogate Advertising is one among the apparent trends of advertisements in advertising industry in India. This trend is clearly helpful for the effective advertisement of many banned products in India. As a result, the indirect advertisement of such products brings about strong effects on consumer response. This creates the duplication of one product’s brand image which is helpful to promote another product of same brand. For instance, the advertisement of Bagpiper soda rings in the ears and flashes in the eyes of the consumer the memory of the hot drink which has the same brand name. Thus, the advertisement of the soda acts as a surrogate to liquor manufactured under the same brand name.

	abstract = {This paper offers a critical examination of ethical consumption, exploring how it reinforces social identities within the capitalist framework. It argues for the crucial role of educational institutions in addressing ethical consumption within their curricula. While ethical consumption is often promoted for its moral virtues and its potential to address issues such as environmental sustainability and labor rights, the paper contends that it inadvertently perpetuates capitalist ideologies and exacerbates class divisions. Through this lens, the analysis critiques the ways in which ethical consumption practices sustain existing social structures, often cloaked in the guise of moral virtue. The paper suggests that educational institutions should integrate discussion on ethical consumption into their ethics courses in advertising and marketing programs to facilitate a more thorough examination of its consequences. This approach would equip students to critically navigate the complexities of ethical consumer choices, fostering a generation of informed, discerning, and socially responsible consumers. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Unless there is an open acknowledgement of responsibility for the Troubles by the principal historical actors, it is difficult to see how northern nationalists and Ulster unionists might contentedly cohabit within an all-Ireland state. A disavowal of past violence, it is argued, is an essential part of laying the moral foundations for a new Ireland.

	abstract = {In 2011, the German government introduced Industry 4.0. A decade later, the European Commission initiated a new area of revolution named Industry 5.0. Based on the latest studies, this article explains the reasons behind the introduction of this new industry. It confirms the idea that I5.0 is a revolution rather than the evolution of I4.0. The Fifth Industrial Revolution, 5.0, aims to improve on the drawbacks of the previous one. Previous researchers have stated that, despite its benefits, I4.0 has lost its human and environmental dimension. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I4.0 did not prove resilient enough to withstand the disruption and be recovered later. Therefore, Industry 5.0 supplements I4.0’s focus on three core values: human centricity, sustainability, and resilience. I5.0 will address the fundamental issue of the loss of human employees in the industry and the promotion of skills and diversities through innovative ways such as Operator 5.0 or Co-bots. Additionally, tighter cooperation between people, machines, and digital technologies is required in order to achieve mass personalisation. Mass personalisation helps achieve environmental and economic sustainability as well as industry resilience. Recent studies have shown that, despite Industry 5.0’s contribution to the world economy, ecology, and society, we will face many challenges during its implementation. The first challenge is developing the soft and practical skills of the workforce and other necessary abilities to execute Industry 5.0 as a whole. Specialised training programs, instructors, and other actors are necessary to offer training sessions for the development of these new soft and practical skills. On the other hand, strict privacy, security, and ethical concerns are necessary for the adoption of disruptive technology applications used in Industry 5.0. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent studies have observed rise in consumer’s ethical concerns about the online retailers while making a purchase decision. The impetus for businesses to use corporate social responsibility (CSR) is evident, but the effects of CSR motives on corresponding processes underlying cause-related marketing (CRM) patronage intention have not been thoroughly examined. This study, anchored on attribution theory, established a research model that better explains the influence of CSR motives on patronage intentions toward CRM-oriented online retailers. Additionally, this study aims to examine the moderating role of spirituality (SPT) on CSR motives and CRM patronage intention (CPI). Design/methodology/approach: Primary data has been collected from 722 respondents and analyzed by using deep neural-network architecture by using the innovative PLS-SEM-ANN method to predict/rank the factors impacting CPI. Findings: The results revealed the normalized importance of the predictors of CPI and found that value-driven motive was the strongest predictor, followed by strategic motive, SPT, age and stakeholder-driven motive. In contrast, egoistic motive, education and income were found insignificant. Originality/value: The pandemic has transformed the way consumers shop and fortified the online economy, thereby resulting in a paradigm shift toward usage of e-commerce platforms. The results offer valuable insights to online retailers and practitioners for predicting patronage intentions by CSR motives and, thus, effectively engage CRM consumers by designing promotions in a way that would deeply resonate with them. This study assessed and predicted the factors influencing the CPI s, thereby guiding the online retailers to design CSR strategies and manage crucial CRM decisions. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Existing debates on business ethics under-represent consumers’ perspectives. In order to progress understanding of ethical judgement in the marketplace, we unpack the interconnections between consumer ethical judgment, consent and context. We address the question of how consumers judge the morality of threat-based experiential marketing communications. Our interpretive qualitative research shows that consumers can feel positively about being shocked, judging threat appeals as more or less ethical by the nature of the negative emotions they experience. We also determine that the intersection between ethical judgement, consent and context lies where consumers’ perceptions of fairness and consequences lend contextualised normative approval to marketing practice. Our research makes three original contributions to existing literature. First, it extends theory in the area of ethical judgement, by highlighting the importance of consent for eliciting positive moral responses. Second, it adds to embryonic research addressing the role of emotions in ethical judgement, by ascertaining that negative emotions can elicit positive consumer ethical judgement. Third, our research contributes an original concept to ethical judgement theorisation, namely consumer-experienced positive shock (CEPS). We define CEPS as a consensual shock value judged as ethical due to its ephemerality, commercial resonance, brand alignment, target-audience appropriateness and contextual acceptability. We also extrapolate the dimensions of CEPS into an ethical judgement typology, elucidating how consumers judge some threat-based communications as ethical, but not others. Consequently, our work dovetails with wider business ethics debates on ethical judgement, adding value by clarifying the conditions that generate positive consumer ethical judgement. © 2019, The Author(s).},

Underpinned by the “computers are social actors” (CASA) paradigm and the Uncanny Valley theory, this study employed five focus groups with photo elicitation to investigate the key factors that inhibit audience engagement with VIs in tourism contexts. Embodiment (poor visual narrative, humanised content, and spillover effect from VI to content), the role of agency (ethical concerns and lack of relatability) and agent feature (uncanny appearance) were identified as primary impediments. While VIs are found to be alternative tourism endorsers in prevailing research, this study contributes to the literature by delineating the limitations of VIs in engaging with audiences, thereby providing critical insights for both scholars and practitioners. The findings consolidate the CASA paradigm by elucidating its boundary conditions, discerning the relationship between the CASA paradigm and the Uncanny Valley theory, and enabling practitioners to avoid pitfalls and adopt VIs more effectively. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {In the current context of the European Union, there is a marked interest in adapting to the digital era, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) regulation and data management. The European Parliament has taken the initiative to formulate a regulatory framework for AI, seeking to protect intellectual property rights and encourage technological development. In parallel, the adoption of the Data Act represents a significant effort to ensure fair access to and use of data, marking a significant turning point in the creation of a data market that is fair to citizens and competitive in the global marketplace. This emerging regulatory environment poses challenges. On the one hand, the increasing autonomation in the creation of artistic content through AI presents dilemmas on how to effectively balance copyright with the promotion of innovation. On the other hand, the Data Act seeks to establish rules on data access and use across all economic sectors, which raises questions about how data security and privacy will be handled in this new framework. The training process carried out with Machine Learning (ML) models and their evolution through Large Language Models (LLM) interfaces based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems must be addressed in the interest of preserving rights and promoting competition. The role of the legislator in the protection of personal data within the EU Member States presents a challenge of an economic-competitive nature and may limit the development of state-of-the-art models, which could have an impact on the region’s competitiveness vis-à-vis other economic areas such as those around the United States or China. Upcoming regulatory developments in the EU, such as the implementation of the Data Act, should address these challenges, ensuring that both individuals and businesses have more robust control over their data. Interoperability and data portability are crucial in this context, underlining the need for safeguards against illicit data transfer. The academic debate is now at a point of vital importance, as it is likely to determine the granularity of the approaches needed for the EU to successfully implement these regulations, balancing the promotion of a fair and competitive digital marketplace with the protection of privacy and individual autonomy. These regulatory changes will influence Europe’s position in the global digital economy, determining how the ethical issues associated with the use of AI will be managed. The implications of these developments for the protection of rights, the promotion of innovation and the impact on the digital economy require in-depth and ongoing analysis. This is a challenging time for the academic community. Regulatory decisions will determine the framework for market action and will condition the EU’s competitiveness in the medium to long term. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

These new tools highly automate extreme changes to—and the entire generation of— advertisements. Examples range from changing a model’s skin tone, age, or gender to swapping the entire body or voice of a model. This investigation finds that these creative tools may cause potentially dramatic changes in how advertisements are conceived, produced, edited, and targeted.

	abstract = {Learning outcomes: After reading and analyzing the case study, the students would be able to understand the complexities of leadership and decision-making in a diverse workplace, specifically when promoting differently abled employees; explore the importance of fostering an inclusive environment, addressing biases and developing empathy in the context of leadership and diversity; explore the challenges and considerations involved in managing a team with diverse backgrounds and abilities; and evaluate the potential impact of promoting employees with disabilities on the morale and retention of other team members. Case overview/synopsis: This case study is about a hearing-impaired individual, Jessica, who was recently hired by a medium-sized organization, Zerial Education. She was the organization’s first hire with a disability, and some of her colleagues were skeptical about how she would fit in. There was a clear bias against her because of her disability, and she faced many challenges while proving herself and earning the respect of her colleagues. Despite the initial skepticism and bias, she quickly proved herself to be a valuable member of the team. As the appraisal period arrived, Stan Logan, her reporting manager, faced a tough decision. He wanted to be fair and avoid to seem to be biased, yet he was also committed to fostering diversity and inclusion. If he promoted Jessica, it would affirm the company’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity, and it would also validate Jessica’s impressive year of work. However, this might come at the cost of creating tensions among the other top performers who were also deserving of the promotion and potentially complicating client interactions owing to Jessica’s hearing impairment. Logan had to navigate these complexities and make a decision that aligned with both the company’s values and operational needs, while also considering the potential consequences on team morale and client relationships. Complexity academic level: The case is suitable for use by students at an MBA level. Human resource management: In this course, students might learn about the legal and ethical issues surrounding disability in the workplace, as well as strategies for recruiting and retaining employees with disabilities. Organizational behavior: In this course, students might learn about the psychological and social factors that influence how individuals with disabilities are perceived and treated in organizations, as well as how to promote diversity and inclusion within a company.

This study delves into the complex interplay between AI/ML, consumer involvement, and social media marketing methods. Our research exposes crucial insights via careful data collecting, sentiment analysis, and the construction of prediction models. By stressing the importance of catering content to individual interests, AI-driven customization emerges as a potent tool, increasing user engagement by 18%. Analysis of online sentiment shows how important it is to keep people feeling good about a business; postings with positive feelings get 30% more likes and comments on average. Accurate and time-saving insights from machine learning models provide up new avenues for optimizing marketing's use of available resources. As a result of the study's conclusions, companies will be able to better connect with their customers, use their resources more efficiently, and behave ethically moving forward. Promising new developments in the subject include the next steps, which include sophisticated AI models, temporal dynamics analysis, and investigation of long-term consequences, ethical issues, and multichannel techniques.

	abstract = {Critics of persuasive advertising argue that it undermines the autonomy of consumers by manipulating their desires in morally problematic ways. My aim is this paper is to refine that argument by employing a conception of autonomy that is not at odds with certain forms of manipulation. I argue that the charge of manipulation is not sufficient for condemning persuasive advertising. On my view, manipulation of an agent’s desires through advertising is justifiable in cases where the agent accepts (or would accept) the process through which the desires were developed. I show how the standard manipulation objection proves too much as it would also condemn cases of that kind. I argue that this distinction is especially important when we consider the implications of “new media.” In addition to increasing vulnerability to manipulation, new media have considerable impacts on well-being. By siding with the traditional autonomy argument, we would be compelled to take an implausible stand against all forms of manipulation through advertising, but I suggest that only a proper subset of those cases are morally problematic. This conclusion opens up a space for persuasive advertising that is permissible while nevertheless condemning cases that violate consumers’ autonomy. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

The increasing influence of AI in influencing customer experiences, optimizing business operations, and revolutionizing marketing strategies is clearly evident in several research. Transparency, adaptability, and the requirement for algorithms that can be explained are important considerations when dealing with the intricacies of integrating AI. The recommendations prioritize ongoing investment in AI literacy, clear transparency regarding data usage, and a flexible approach to customization to adapt to changing consumer preferences. The significance of interdisciplinary collaborations and robust frameworks is emphasized by ethical considerations in the deployment of AI, particularly regarding biases and concerns about privacy.

	abstract = {This article explores the impact of an Increase in the average Number of Authors per Publication (INAP) on known ethical issues of authorship. For this purpose, the ten most common ethical issues associated with scholarly authorship are used to set up a taxonomy of existing issues and raise awareness among the community to take precautionary measures and adopt best practices to minimize the negative impact of INAP. We confirm that intense international, interdisciplinary and complex collaborations are necessary, and INAP is an expression of this trend. However, perverse incentives aimed to increase institutional and personal publication counts and egregious instances of guest or honorary authorship are problematic. We argue that whether INAP is due to increased complexity and scale of science, perverse incentives or undeserved authorship, it could negatively affect known ethical issues of authorship at some level. In the long run, INAP depreciates the value of authorship status and may disproportionately impact junior researchers and those who contribute to technical and routine tasks. We provide two suggestions that could reduce the long-term impact of INAP on the reward system of science. First, we suggest further refinement of the CRediT taxonomy including better integration into current systems of attribution and acknowledgement, and better harmony with major authorship guidelines such as those suggested by the ICMJE. Second, we propose adjustments to the academic recognition and promotion systems at an institutional level as well as the introduction of best practices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates how the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) governs advertising ethics with and on behalf of its members and stakeholders. Drawing on an archive of 310 non-commercial (i.e., not-for-profit and public) adjudication reports, we highlight the substantive norms and procedural mechanisms through which the ASA governs advertising complaints alleging offence and/or harm. Substantively, the ASA precludes potential normative transgressions by publishing, disseminating, consulting upon, and updating detailed codes of advertising conduct. Procedurally, the ASA adjudicates between allegations and justifications of offence and harm on a received complaint-by-complaint basis, often upon consequentialist grounds. Such consequentialism, we claim, has the effect of normalizing power imbalances between the ASA’s members, on the one hand, and wider stakeholders, on the other hand. The paper argues that, in the context of UK advertising, what Michel Foucault called the right ‘to be or not to be governed like that’ is enjoyed by relatively few subjects. Having demonstrated how UK advertising practices are governed, the paper closes with suggestions as to how they might be governed otherwise. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As social media increasingly permeates everyday life, ethical concerns about its use are coming into sharper focus. At the same time, the ethical issues involved in social media marketing have received somewhat limited attention from marketing research and practice. Therefore, many scholars are calling out for a better understanding of the role of ethics in social media marketing decisions. Current marketing ethics theories do not sufficiently consider the unique dynamics of social media. To aid researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, we propose a theoretical framework to address issues in social media marketing ethics built on theories of normative and descriptive ethics. This framework considers the normative and descriptive ethics within firm-internal and firm-external factors in the fields of law, regulation and norms, platform conditions, and stakeholder value. Then, applying a thematically built systematic literature review, we identify and discuss five distinct themes of research in social media marketing ethics: (I) advertising and customer–brand relationships; (II) the dark side of social media; (III) privacy; (IV) fake news; and (V) emerging research. These themes and their implications are discussed using the proposed theoretical framework. Our study provides a comprehensive overview and synthesis of ethical challenges in social media marketing and suggests possible research avenues for the future. In doing so, it outlines pressing issues that require attention from researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to ensure an ethically sustainable approach to social media marketing. © The Author(s) 2025.},

It investigates the use of ChatGPT in personalized learning, assessment and content creation and examines ways to manage its limitations and some ethical considerations. The purpose is to stimulate discussion on the effective application of ChatGPT as a tool for learning and skill development while remaining mindful of the ethical issues involved. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology in this article includes four steps: a literature search, screening and selection, analysis and synthesis. The literature was thoroughly screened and selected on the basis of its relevance to the research question, before selected material were carefully read and analyzed. The insights gained from this analysis were then synthesized to identify key considerations in integrating ChatGPT in education. Findings: The study concludes that ChatGPT can be effectively integrated into education to automate routine tasks and enhance the learning experience for students, ultimately increasing productivity and efficiency and fostering adaptive learning. However, the limitations of ChatGPT, even when updated, must be borne in mind, including factual inconsistencies, potential bias promotion, lack of in-depth understanding and safety concerns. The study nevertheless highlights the benefits of responsibly integrating ChatGPT within the field of education. Practical implications: This study has practical implications for educators and policymakers who are interested in the integration of AI technology in education. The study provides insights of using ChatGPT in education. Originality/value: This article contributes to the existing literature by specifically examining the advantages of integrating ChatGPT in higher education and offering recommendations for its responsible use. Moreover, the article emphasizes ethical considerations in the context of ChatGPT integration. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to conceptually integrate business to consumer (B2C) into business to business (B2B), with a holistic consumer-centric, technology-reinforced, long-term vision for tourism industries and companies to survive and succeed in the era of new technologies 4.0. The research suggests that the tourism-marketing-new technologies decision-making involves customers as the center of the design and decision process. Design/methodology/approach: The research design includes a qualitative study with 94 in-depth interviews, a literature analysis and a conceptual proposition. The qualitative study follows the tourism consumer desire data analysis, from categorization to integration. The literature analysis applies a systematic literature review approach based on the 29 most up-to-date new-tech papers from peer-reviewed journals. The analysis compares qualitative research findings and literature analysis results and matches the new technology applications with consumer desire understanding. The conceptual framework of tourism marketing/advertising is proposed based on qualitative research and literature analysis. Findings: The qualitative research deciphers that consumers, based on their imagination and memorization, desire therapy and sceneries and connect such desires to the empathetic and resonating advertising messages. The literature analysis synthesizes the new tech applications in tourism and matches the qualitative research findings with the deciphered desires in tourism. The conceptual model proposes that B2C should be integrated into B2B to provide value for both consumers and businesses and opens avenues of research on this topic. Research limitations/implications: This research has made the following theoretical contributions: it offers an in-depth understanding of consumer desire, often hidden or subconscious, in the field of tourism. Consumer desires regarding tourism are mostly subconscious and exist long before consumers are exposed to advertising messages. These desires reflect the search for therapy and sceneries and become “embodied” – they exist on multisensorial levels and become part of the body and life and will lead consumers into positive perceptions when marketing communications/advertisements resonate with them. In the latter case, they will subjectively judge advertising as “good,” regardless of the advertising design quality. The research also connects consumer research with a new technologies research review and proposes a conceptual framework to integrate business to consumer (B2C) with business to business (B2B). As such, the research makes theoretical contributions to the integration or the “boundary blurring” between B2C and B2B research and practical suggestions that involved industries and consumers may all benefit from such integration. Conceptually, there is a lack of discussions of the pitfalls of new technologies, a dearth of empirical verification of the applications of new technologies in the proposed fields and a shortage of discussions about ethical issues. Qualitative methods, offering an efficient tool for understanding consumer desires in the tourism industry, have their own limits, as discussed in previous research. The sample is limited to the state of New York population and may be influenced by geographic, demographic and psychological characteristics related to the region. Practical implications: This research provides advertising practitioners, new technology innovators and tourism industries with a framework to face the combined challenges of understanding hidden consumer desires and applying adequate technologies that resonate with consumer desires to tackle relevant issues. The conceptual proposition of this research fills the gap between qualitative consumer research without concrete practical resolution and new technologies applications without in-depth consumer understanding. Through the conceptual framework, the author provides insights into how industries may benefit from consumer understanding. The business relationships among the industries of marketing, tourism and new technologies should be centered around consumers. Thus, B2C and B2B should be naturally integrated into business practices. Social implications: Social implications of this research include three major points: first, the understanding of consumer desire for therapeutic power in tourism, which invites more attention to tourism as part of social well-being design instead of a purely for-profit business. Second, a profound comprehension of what consumers need and desire, without which the applications of new technologies may cause severe societal problems. Third, a way to tailor to consumers’ individuality and desires for advertising/marketing that may be considered abusive, stressful and socially destructive if applied in a nonpersonal manner. Originality/value: Conceptually, this research adds consumer desire, an originally B2C concept, to the B2B context regarding the new technology applications in tourism marketing/advertising. It contributes to the B2B literature by proposing a strong consumer-centric approach, especially the consumer desire understanding, that is not yet investigated in the B2B literature; and a combination of empirical study and literature analysis and the matching of the two for better practice of advertising/marketing, tourism and new technologies applications. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore the consumer insights and ethical concerns surrounding the online payday loan services available in the Google Play Store. This research was conducted to compare whether the presence or absence of debt collection protection acts in a country creates differences in consumer experiences regarding the ethics of payday loan collection. Specifically, the study compares customers’ experiences in both the Indonesian and US markets. Design/methodology/approach: Indonesia and the USA were chosen because they have very different regulatory structures for the payday loan industry. The data was scraped using Python from 27 payday loan apps on the Indonesian Play Store, resulting in a total of 244,697 reviews extracted from the Indonesian market. For the US market, 446,010 reviews were extracted from 14 payday loan apps. The data was further analyzed using NVIVO. Findings: The results suggest that consumers of payday loans in Indonesia and the USA hold positive views about the benefits of payday loan apps, as revealed by the word frequency and word cloud analysis. Notably, customers in both countries did not express any negative sentiments regarding the unethical interest rate charged by the payday loan, contradicting what is commonly reported in academic literature. However, a distinct pattern of unethical conduct was observed in both countries concerning marketing communication and debt collection practices. In the Indonesian market, payday loan companies were found to engage in unethical debt collection activities. In the US market, payday lenders exhibited unethical behavior in their marketing communication, particularly through deceptive advertising that makes promises to consumers that are not delivered. Originality/value: The study aims to provide evidence on the various experiences of customers in the presence and absence of debt collection regulations using a novel methodology and a large sample, which strengthens the results and conclusions of the study. The study also intends to inform policymakers, particularly the Indonesian government, about the need for specific laws to regulate the debt collection process and prevent unethical practices. Ultimately, the study is expected to protect the rights of consumers from a deceptive marketing communication or unethical debt collection practices in both the Indonesian and US markets. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

In addressing authorship, agency, and the very essence of creation, the changing position of artists as co-creators with intelligent algorithms is explored. It also looks at how AI can question and change conventional ideas of creative competence. Additionally, this study looks into how AI affects the promotion and distribution of art. AI-driven marketing tactics provide improved targeting of customers, personalized experiences, and optimal promotional efforts by utilizing insights based on data and predictive analytics. The study focuses on how these developments transform the relationships between galleries and artists and their patrons, ultimately fostering a more varied and inclusive art scene. The system's potential in many healthcare scenarios has been validated through simulations and practical experiments, which have received excellent feedback from healthcare providers. A critical review emphasizes the need to address practical deployment issues and data security concerns, while also highlighting the exciting convergence of IoT healthcare devices and DDRL. The paper ends with suggestions for more research, highlighting the significance of ethical issues, user interface improvements, and real-world validation.

We interviewed 28 representatives from different actor groups in the German influencer industry (influencers, client organizations, and intermediaries such as influencer marketing agencies) to systematically identify ethical issues and the moral expectations underlying these issues. In analyzing the interview data in a qualitative content analysis, we identify ten ethical issues: autonomy, transparency, sincerity, truthfulness, caring, professionalism, reciprocity, respect, loyalty, and social responsibility. Our study adds to the body of knowledge by further substantiating the discussion on transparency, payments, and authenticity; by introducing previously neglected ethical issues; by organizing the field of influencer industry ethics; and by explaining how the specific constellation of ethical issues in the influencer industry levels out the distinction between sponsored and organic content. In doing so, we argue for a broad perspective on influencer industry ethics that positions influencer communication at the intersection between Public Relations, advertising, and journalism. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Digital ads on social-media platforms play an important role in shaping access to economic opportunities. Our work proposes and implements a new third-party auditing method that can evaluate racial bias in the delivery of ads for education opportunities. Third-party auditing is important because it allows external parties to demonstrate presence or absence of bias in social-media algorithms. Education is a domain with legal protections against discrimination and concerns of racial-targeting, but bias induced by ad delivery algorithms has not been previously explored in this domain. Prior audits demonstrated discrimination in platforms' delivery of ads to users for housing and employment ads. These audit findings supported legal action that prompted Meta to change their ad-delivery algorithms to reduce bias, but only in the domains of housing, employment, and credit. In this work, we propose a new methodology that allows us to measure racial discrimination in a platform's ad delivery algorithms for education ads. We apply our method to Meta using ads for real schools and observe the results of delivery. We find evidence of racial discrimination in Meta's algorithmic delivery of ads for education opportunities, posing legal and ethical concerns. Our results extend evidence of algorithmic discrimination to the education domain, showing that current bias mitigation mechanisms are narrow in scope, and suggesting a broader role for third-party auditing of social media in areas where ensuring non-discrimination is important.  © 2024 Owner/Author.},

The Certified Ethical Advertising Executive (CEAE) certificate course was added to the curriculum in two undergraduate marketing courses in Fall of 2023. The same courses were taught by the same instructors in the semester prior (Spring 2023). The only substantive difference between the two semesters was that students in the Fall semester were required to complete the CEAE course as a course assignment. An online survey was used to measure students’ attitudes toward advertising ethics at the end of each semester. Results showed significant shifts on 9 of 12 survey metrics. The authors conclude that the CEAE course is an effective tool for teaching ethical advertising principles in the university setting. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Design/methodology/approach: Based on 36 semi-structured interviews with sustainability rating practitioners, the study shows the trade-offs, ethical judgments and customizable aspects involved in rating practices, which cannot rely only on formal and predefined methods. Findings: In contrast with the official optimistic rhetoric about the rationality and rigor of sustainability rating methods, agencies face serious challenges in the measurement and comparison of performance in this area, particularly in terms of the aggregation of scattered and fuzzy indicators, commercial pressures and the availability, materiality and reliability of the information collected. Despite these concerns, sustainability ratings do appear to be useful in improving corporate responsiveness and increasing investor awareness of the complex and difficult-to-measure aspects of nonfinancial reports. Practical implications: Rating agencies should collaborate to set up common indicators that would be easier for firms to produce and should better separate their sustainability rating production activities from other services they offer to companies (e.g. consultancy). Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the measurement and promotion of corporate sustainability by analyzing rating practices through the lens of moral fictionalism, which here refers to the human tendency to build ethical judgments on fictional but convenient and useful representations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This study is based on a qualitative content analysis of 77 briefs submitted to a public hearing organized by the National Assembly of Quebec (Canada) on pesticide use, which led to 30 testimonies from stakeholders that either oppose or defend the use of pesticides. This study highlights the sustainability-related stigma faced by organizations vilified because of the environmental, health and ethical issues raised at the hearing. The results also show the impression management strategies and neutralization techniques used by these organizations to respond to the stigma. These techniques are essentially based on neutralizing the stigma (denial, claims of victimhood, defense of social justice and rural traditions) and on the exemplification of existing practices (sustainability stewardship, promotion of science and progress, fight against common enemies). The article contributes to the literature on organizational stigma and on neutralization techniques by proposing an integrative model illustrating the main strategies used by companies to defend the legitimacy of controversial activities.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of two different sustainable marketing initiatives employed on the website of a prominent fast fashion brand on consumer perceptions and intentions to modify their shopping behavior. The examination focuses on understanding the nature and extent of shoppers’ responses to these marketing initiatives. Given the complexity of consumer perceptions, 100 semi-structured interviews with shoppers in the field were conducted to better understand the phenomenon under research. We transcribed shoppers’ responses and conducted a qualitative content analysis of their self-reports. Our results show that fast fashion shoppers demonstrate a spectrum of responses. Sustainable marketing initiatives that enable consumers to be actively involved were perceived more positively. In conclusion, it can be inferred that fast fashion brands engage in sustainable marketing primarily to cultivate positive emotions and assuage ethical concerns among consumers, thereby fostering brand loyalty and customer retention. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have been on the rise in recent years. These technologies have had a great impact on the marketing field and, especially, consumer behaviour. This paper examines the potential and influence of AR and VR as a shaping trend in consumer behaviour, including their usage across various industries and their impact on consumer engagement, purchasing experience and decision-making. We are discovering the challenges that are occurring with the adoption of AR and VR in marketing and retail, such as the need for innovation, privacy concerns, and potential ethical issues. Opportunities that those technologies bring with their adoption are also researched, including personalized shopping experiences, interactive advertising or virtual showrooms. The importance of the consumer perspective on the topic and the way marketers understand this perspective are also highlighted. This way, we provide information not only from the marketers' point of view but also, from the consumers` one, including challenges and obstacles they may face while interacting with selected technologies. At the end of the article, we suggest ways how companies may implement AR and VR in their marketing strategy, which in turn would provide them with the value they can give to their customers as well as an enhanced brand image on the market. Suggested ways may also be used as a starting point for further research, where a complex model of implementation would be created. The main goal of the article is to provide readers with information that brings a comprehensive understanding of the role AR and VR have in modern marketing, how it is shaping consumer behaviour, and how big and small businesses can use those technologies to stay competitive in an ever-changing environment.

The findings of this study may help alleviate such ethical concerns. Teenagers’ use of OSNs contributes to the development of a social skill—theory of mind (ToM)—which helps them interpret advertisements and detect deceptive contents. With regard to ethics-oriented outcomes, the findings confirm that ToM discourages youth materialism, which may be encouraged by inappropriate advertising, thereby demonstrating the utility of ToM in mitigating the adverse consequences of unethical marketing. Moreover, OSNs have reshaped how teenagers acquire ToM, such that they replace offline interactions (i.e., offline friendship quantity/quality) to play a central role in ToM development. Although OSNs expose teenagers to the harms of online marketing, they also empower teens to enhance their social skills, which potentially protect them from deceptive advertising. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

Thirty-four in-depth interviews with advertising practitioners were undertaken to assess the type of ethical considerations experienced by professionals today. Deceptive advertising was selected for a shared context in assessing level and process of ethical reasoning. Two scholarly frameworks focusing on cognitive moral development and ethical decision making were used to provide structure to the research. Participants expressed a general concern for deceptive advertising and converged on conceptual definitions. However, none had formal ethics-based training to equip them to recognize and avoid deceptive advertising, and most viewed deceptive advertising in terms of legal—not ethical or social—constraints and consequences. Comparisons with prior research indicate similar patterns in relation to experiencing Moral Myopia and practitioners operating outside the ‘Principled’ level of ethical concern from the cognitive moral development framework, but new and different areas also surfaced.

However, not much attention has been paid to the effect of CRM on small or unknown online retailers. As ethical concerns about the Internet continue to rise, consumers' perceptions regarding the ethics of online retailers (CPEOR) become important when making a purchase decision. This research uses the self-signaling theory to examine how online retailers’ information management and promotional strategy (CRM vs. Price Discount) may emit signals and impact on the consumers’ repurchase intention. It was assumed that a high CPEOR would work better with a CRM-based strategy, which is fundamentally aligning in ethics. However, the experimental results surprisingly revealed that when CPEOR was high, the consumers’ repurchase intention increased in the case of a Price Discount-based promotion when compared to a CRM-based promotion; the effect was the opposite when consumers’ CPEOR was low. ANCOVA was used to analyze the data while setting certain variables as covariates. This research is a meaningful contribution to the literature and serves as an important reference for e-commerce practitioners to understand how they can wisely manage the information on the online storefront to signal their consumers and create an incremental value for the business. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown pushed people to buy more online. With the increase in online shopping, there was also an increase in ethical issues with electronic retailers resulting from problems with products, misleading price practices, lack of customers’ personal and financial data protection, non-delivery of goods, and misleading advertising. This study aimed to determine whether consumers’ perceptions of e-retailers’ ethics influence online customer experience and satisfaction when purchasing products and services. A research model was developed based on the literature on ethics in e-commerce. To fulfill the objective, a research model on consumer perceptions of ethics in online retailing was tested based on answers of 501 Brazilian online shoppers. Data were gathered through an online questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling with an estimation of minimum least squares. The results indicated significant relations between the e-retailer's ethics, the online experience, and customer satisfaction with the mediation of ethical beliefs, suggesting that the e-retailer's ethics can potentially stimulate a good online consumer experience and satisfaction when purchasing on the internet and may contribute to the relationship between the consumer and the e-retailer. Furthermore, ethical beliefs can mediate these relations, collaborating with the effect of e-retailers’ ethics on the consumer's experience and satisfaction. These results represent an advance in the study of new ethical dimensions in electronic retail, which currently are reduced to security and privacy issues. In practice, this study resulted in new knowledge about ethical practices that can guide electronic retailers in the adoption of new customer prospecting strategies. It also highlights the importance of improving regulations that prevent certain behaviors from happening. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We reflected on the co-creation of vlogs by community members and professionals. The results show that co-creating vlogs enabled meaningful engagement of citizens living in vulnerable circumstances and promoted shared learning. Community members who were not involved in the vlog creation were critical of the vlogs. However, watching the vlogs stimulated discussion and reflection. Therefore, dissemination of vlogs in a setting guided by a professional seems to have the potential to facilitate shared learning. Despite the popularity of vlogs, this study highlights the need to carefully consider the use of vlogs in relation to a study’s aims and to respond to (ethical) concerns. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The research aims to investigate how individuals can be persuaded to make purchases through repeated and personalized messages. Specifically, the study proposes a framework of the potential benefits and risks of the online behavioral and data-driven digital advertising (OBA), which can help researchers and practitioners to better understand shopping behavior in the online retailing setting. In addition, the research focuses on the role of privacy concerns in affecting avoidance or adoption of OBA. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach with partial least square (PLS) regression method to test the research hypotheses through data coming from a structured questionnaire. Findings: OBA is a controversial type of advertising that activates opposing reactions on consumers' perspective. Specifically, acceptance of the OBA is positively related to relevance, usefulness and credibility of the personalized advertisements, while the intention to avoid personalized ads is strictly related to the privacy concerns. Consequently, OBA acceptance and avoidance affected the click intention on the ad and the behavioral intention that are decisive for the success of data-driven digital advertising. Originality/value: Prior research came up with complex theoretical frameworks that explain antecedents of OBA focusing only on ethical issues in marketing, on the effectiveness of a single OBA campaign or on how to create a successful advertising campaign. However, no study focuses on the intended or actual behavior of shoppers. Specifically, filling the gap in the existing literature, our research applies an SEM approach to identify both benefits and risks and the antecedents of the actual behavior of individuals in terms of actual purchases promoted by OBA. © 2021, Simone Aiolfi, Silvia Bellini and Davide Pellegrini.},

This paper delves into the dual facets of AI-driven social media marketing techniques, investigating both their advantageous and detrimental impacts. It shows that by leveraging AI, businesses can achieve unprecedented levels of personalisation, engagement and efficiency in their marketing strategies, leading to enhanced customer experiences and increased brand loyalty. AI algorithms analyse vast amounts of data to identify trends and predict consumer behaviour, enabling precise targeting and optimised advertising spend. The paper utilises a qualitative research method to explore the AI-driven social media marketing techniques used by digital marketing and social media marketing professionals. The findings suggest that reliance on AI may perpetuate biases embedded in the training data, leading to ethical concerns and a loss of trust among consumers. This paper highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines to mitigate risks while harnessing the full potential of AI in social media marketing. Ultimately, understanding both the bright and dark sides of AI-driven marketing is crucial for developing strategies that are not only effective but also ethical and sustainable. © Henry Stewart Publications.},

The newly emerging field of computational advertising is undergoing dynamic development, and this concept is now placed in the context of advanced intelligent systems, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality. According to the specified parameters, a systematic literature search of scientific publications was carried out and subsequently evaluated. The research questions are focused on the identification of intelligent systems and current consumer neuroscience tools finding application in the current trend of computational advertising. It follows from the processed systematic literature review that there are currently a number of intelligent systems and also a number of tools in the field of consumer neuroscience that can find application within the broader concept of computational advertising. These more or less intelligent systems and neuroscientific tools are already affecting all phases of the advertising life cycle. At the same time, a number of ethical issues associated with the use of both these technologies and tools have been found, which still need to be explored. The article attempts to fill the gap in the lack of literature dealing with this issue. Last but not least, the article contains a critical view of these new technological possibilities and also describes a number of new ethical challenges arising in this area.  © 2024 Robert Zámečník., published by Sciendo.},

It further examines whether the use of various promotional techniques including advertisements, sales promotions, personal selling and direct marketing by pharmaceutical companies influences the prescription behavior of doctors. Based on the increasing ethical concerns regarding the promotion of specific drugs for personal gains, the research also investigated the moderating role of ethical ideology in the above relationship. Design/methodology/approach: To accomplish the research goals, quantitative research methods were used. Using the online questionnaire, data were collected from 93 doctors working in government and private hospitals in Pakistan, and structural equation modeling technique was used to analyze the impact of pharmaceutical marketing techniques on the prescription decisions of physicians. Findings: The findings suggested that marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies positively influences the prescription behavior of doctors. Further, physicians having weak ethical standards are likely to be strongly influenced by the marketing and promotional practices of companies. Practical implications: The research is pivotal in understanding the perspective of doctors and the ethical considerations that need to be addressed while devising the marketing campaigns by pharmaceutical companies. Further, these findings provide important implications regarding the essential linkage between ethical values and the development of right marketing tools. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is one of the first few to empirically develop and test the role of moral values followed by physicians when they take prescription decisions. Based on the findings, future researchers are encouraged to further investigate the need of setting boundaries for pharmaceutical companies and restricting their usage regarding the promotional tactics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It is key to avoid the abuse of users not aware of the economic value of their data, as well as their manipulation through advertising in digital markets, and by predicting their behavior, also to avoid the abuse of consumers’ ignorance about the ethics of the products/services they consume. The European Union, through the Artificial Intelligence Act, developed a set of rules to safeguard the impact of AI on society and mitigate the adverse consequences of unethical behaviors, but these unethical AI practices are still occurring. This study uses an event model to calculate cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) with registered data on fines from AI ethical violations to measure the impact on financial markets of news about the unethical behavior of offending firms and to determine whether shareholders are rewarding these activities. Results help explain how some firms and their shareholders become immune to financial economic sanctions and turn into multi-violators who are not affected by the amount of the fines imposed on them, developing a “fine is a price” attitude. In summary, the findings of this study advise companies against engaging in this type of malpractice and make a great contribution in helping governments prevent the misuse of AI and its potentially disastrous consequences at both the individual and societal levels. © 2023 Tomas Bata University in Zlín.

	abstract = {Influencer advertising has become a multibillion-dollar industry, with young people playing a large role. While there are ethical concerns regarding targeting an audience too young to comprehend this subtle form of advertising, clear disclosures can help trigger children’s persuasion knowledge. Some influencers and sponsors have expressed concern that prominent disclosures will negatively affect their ability to persuade, but the persuasion knowledge model (PKM) suggests that when audiences perceive advertising to be informative and/or entertaining, the positive aspects can trump resistance to persuasion. The current two-study investigation therefore examines the intersection of the PKM and developmental theory (theory of mind) to determine how children (ages five to twelve years) and adolescents (ages thirteen to seventeen years) perceive influencers’ YouTube videos in the presence of varying types of disclosures. Results suggest that influencers can and should fully disclose advertising content to youth, helping to activate persuasion knowledge without harming the influencer–follower relationship. However, theory of mind emerged as much more strongly associated with activation of persuasion knowledge than any other variables, suggesting that disclosures may not be sufficient for the least mature audiences. Interestingly, aspects of persuasion knowledge were activated even without identifying the video as a form of advertising. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2021 American Academy of Advertising.},

The case for advancing the promotion and normalization of plant-based eating at catering facilities is argued using the threefold dimensions associated with food production. First, the environmental impacts of different food types are discussed. This is followed by an evaluation of healthrelated debates linked to culinary consumption along with a selection of ethical issues involved in food production systems. This review highlights that the environmental sustainability challenges posed by the animal agricultural sector call for innovative and effective mitigating measures that can be linked to the development and promotion of plant-based food consumption which the hospitality industry can actively promote. From the health perspective, plant-based diets can report health benefits in the prevention and treatment of health conditions, but this requires planning by catering providers for nutritionally adequate and wholesome eating. From the ethical dimension, removing animals from the food chain would not only achieve lesser environmental pressures and social issues associated with the consumption of animal-derived produce. This would also reduce the suffering that sentient beings endure across different stages in food production which in turn can improve the hospitality sector’s corporate image and ethical stance whilst progressing positive social messages on sustainability, ethics and health. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Viewpoint.

	abstract = {In Japan, income, authority, and prestige are unequally distributed between men and women, even if they share the same occupational level. These inequalities are perceived as an ethical issue because they go against the principle of equal treatment at work. Nowadays, Japanese companies are under growing political and regulatory pressure to increase the hiring, promotion, and empowerment of female employees. In this context, the first equity index that tracks the financial performance of the best Japanese companies in terms of gender diversity performance—the MSCI Japan Empowering Women Index (hereafter WIN)—was launched in 2010. It aims to satisfy the growing demand of investors who want to reduce gender discrimination in Japanese workplaces. This paper compares the financial performance of the WIN stock index to the conventional parent index over the period 2010–2018, offering a unique setting to assess the effects of gender diversity screens on portfolio risk-adjusted performance. Our results are robust to a battery of risk-adjusted performance indicators and clearly indicate that investing in the WIN equity index does not come at a cost compared to investing in its conventional peer. This evidence is expected to reinforce confidence of investors who have an appetite for justice in increasing their investment in financial products that support the participation and the advancement of women in the Japanese workforce. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {This study explores the role of religious founders in promoting employee welfare in family firms. We propose that a founder’s religious beliefs can shape the cognitive framework for ethical issues and then influence the firm’s employee welfare practices. Empirical tests based on survey data reveal that firms with religious founders are more likely to offer employee welfare than firms without religious founders. This positive relationship is weakened when the firm founder has a political identity. Further analysis shows that the impact of the founder’s religious beliefs on employee welfare is greater for firms located in areas with a stronger religious atmosphere, indicating that religion mainly works through the institutional-forcing channel rather than the faith-driving channel. Overall, our findings provide inspiration for the promotion of employee welfare from an ethical light. © 2021 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand.},

	abstract = {This article examined advertising research topics categorized by connections and tensions between central actors in the advertising ecosystem (advertising industry and advertisers) and other key actors. From a bibliometric analysis of original research articles published in the top three advertising journals during the past 20 years, topical areas were identified where research has been lacking. These topics included: (1) issues at the connection between advertising industry/advertisers and non-government regulatory/watchdog organizations; (2) issues at the connection between advertising industry/advertisers and the government; and (3) macro-environment issues, especially social and technology environment factors. For each of these areas, urgent topics for future advertising research and example research questions were proposed. © 2022 Advertising Association.},
