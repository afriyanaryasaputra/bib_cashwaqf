	abstract = {Studies on waqf have successfully caught the attention of scholars to discuss its various aspects especially the role of waqf in the form of cash waqf in the contemporary environment. Cash waqf is increasingly gaining popularity among Malaysian Muslims, and waqf institutions are expecting more cash contributions in order to develop idle waqf lands. The Malaysian government has also given tax-exemptions for cash waqf donors to encourage more contributions. However, total collection of cash waqf is still not very large. Thus, the waqf institution requires a new mechanism of cash collections as waqf. One way for that is deduction from employment income. This study intends to examine the factors that influence the behavioral intentions of Muslim employees to donate through deductions from employment income. Using Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we attempt to identify the factors that may influence the behavioral intentions of Muslim employees to contribute to cash waqf. A total of 380 Muslim employees, both from public and private sectors, from the Klang Valley, were involved in the study. The results show that the attitude and subjects' norms toward behavioral intentions are distinctively noted by the respondent. Furthermore, the structural equation model used in the study verified the structural relationship between attitude, subjective norms and behavioral intentions of Muslim employees. It is also found that the attitude of Muslim employees has more influence compared to subjective norms.},

	abstract = {Bangladesh is the third largest Muslim nations by population where madrasah (religious institutions) is still the main provider of Islamic higher education. The history madrasah education dated back to the thirteen century when Bengal was conquered by Muslim. From that time, Madrasah education was largely funded by waqf and it was absolutely free. The residential madrasahs provided free boarding and lodging for the students and the teachers. Since the British occupation, however, the madrasah education system has been neglected and both number of people donating waqf land and number of waqf properties have been declining remarkably. Thus, Islamic higher education is in the crisis of patronization. As an overpopulated nation, the scope of land waqf is limited in Bangladesh. In this case, cash waqf is the suitable alternative for the country. This paper, hence, aims to evaluate the role of cash waqf in the development of Islamic higher education in Bangladesh. © IBTRA 2007-2018.},

In the model, the risk of commodities delivered by farmers to BMT is subsidized or borrowed by Nazhir of waqf land while the surplus of cash waqf is distributed to cover Murabaha margin of necessary agricultural equipment purchased from BMT.

	abstract = {Micro Waqf Bank (BWM) is an Islamic microfinance institution which aims to empower the poor and whose development strategies in Indonesia are examined in this study. To keep empowering the poor, BWM should survive and sustain. This study discovers the main strategies for developing BWM in Indonesia, so that it will survive and sustain. This study employed SWOT analysis which resulted in SWOT matrix and several alternative strategies (SO, ST, WO, and WT strategies). This study also applied ANP to determine the main strategies for developing BWM. Data were obtained from observation, interviews, and literature review. Interviews were conducted with practitioners, experts, regulators, and academics. Among the six alternative strategies for developing BWM in Indonesia, the most crucial is dissemination and education on BWM to the general public. This study is limited to BWM and does not include cash waqf. Nowadays, BWM is the microfinance institution Financial Services Authority (OJK) promotes and becomes the most important instrument in the financial institution sector. Therefore, BWM deserves a closer empirical study. Besides, the bank has the potential to create jobs in the future. The combinations of alternative strategies aide the regulators and managers to decide the best strategies and influential factors for developing BWM in Indonesia. © 2021 RIGEO. All Rights Reserved.},

To assess the viability of this model, we conducted a study adopting the qualitative method. We took in-depth interviews of three experts in Islamic finance and banking by using an open-ended questionnaire articulated with the vital issues of MM&M financing. According to experts’ opinions, relevant skills, religiosity, and product knowledge can be considered clients’ primary attributes for letting them access these financing schemes. Nevertheless, the involvement of third-party guarantors, cash waqf, and technology usage will augment the usefulness of this financing approach.

	abstract = {Background - The success of Waqf as a source of socio-economic financing in Islamic history in developing a country by providing the social and public goods to the society have been a major factor for Waqf practices to be retrieved back today. In order to exterminate the poverty, depending in Zakat alone is not enough. Waqf can be an alternative in solving the socio-economic problem of the Ummah which covers the issues such as poverty, inequality and rising cost of living as well in promoting the social wellbeing in the society. Purpose - The purpose of this article is to analyze the related literatures on Waqf for poverty alleviation and social well-being between 2006 until 2016. Research Methodology - The methodology of this article is through descriptive research based on document analysis on previous articles and literatures on Waqf between 2006 until 2016. From 365 citation found under 'Waqf' keywords which including journal articles, books and conference paper, only 289 articles that are published under journals publications consists of national and international journals were selected and had been analyzed using the Statistical Product & Service Solution (SPSS) software. This study analyzed the articles selected by looking at several variables which including the year of publication, number of authors that contributes in the publish articles, the subject area of articles, the country that study Waqf research and the type of research method associated with the use of qualitative, quantitative and mixed method that used by the researcher. Findings - The general finding of this article shows that among the Waqf issues or subject that have the highest interest among the researcher for the current 10 years are related to the issues of cash Waqf (19.4%), Waqf property (13.8%) and Waqf concept (12.5%). However issues that related to poverty and poverty alleviation (14 articles), microfinance (17 articles) and corporate Waqf (13 articles) have also gained a popularity among the researcher.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to validate a potential synergistic venture between cash waqf (Islamic endowment) institutions (CWIs) and financial cooperatives (FCs) in the provision of affordable Islamic home financing (IHF) in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted semi-structured interviews with ten experts to validate the cash waqf-financial-cooperative-mushārakah mutanāqiṣah (CWFCMM) model. Thematic analysis technique was used to analyse the verbatim texts. Findings: The findings show that the majority of the informants have positive perceptions of the potential of the CWFCMM model to provide financially affordable IHF products in Malaysia. Nevertheless, this study sheds light on the varying degrees of latent issues and challenges that might arise in the implementation of this model. For example, FCs need to practice the correct business model, implement good governance structures and employ the right people. Meanwhile, CWIs need to work on their accountability issues by publishing their audited accounts in mainstream newspapers, much like what is being done by non-governmental organisations such as the widely recognised Malaysian Medical Relief Society (MERCY Malaysia). Research limitations/implications: This study interviewed a small, industry-specific number of informants in generating its findings. Time and budget constraints are some of the limiting factors in carrying out the study. Because of these factors, the generalisation of the study’s findings will be limited. Practical implications: First, the CWFCMM model offers an alternative, financially affordable IHF instrument to low- and middle-income households in Malaysia. Second, the involvement of third-sector institutions such as FCs and CWIs in the provision of IHF will reduce the burden of the government in its spending on home financing solutions for civil servants. Third, this model will harness the potential of waqf-based financing beyond the contemporary limited applications to mosques, graveyards and taḥfīẓ (Qurʾan memorization) schools. Originality/value: This study presents an alternative IHF model that transcends the current institutional framework that is heavily dominated by Islamic commercial banks and government-owned home financing institutions. The study does not focus on a single third-sector institution but on an integration of at least two of them, CWIs and FCs, in implementing the IHF model. © 2018, Mohd Zaidi Md Zabri and Mustafa Omar Mohammed.},

	abstract = {The cash waqf (endowment) has come into prominence in recent years since many Malaysian state Islamic religious councils and the Federal government (through a foundation) began promoting cash waqf schemes. However, unlike the Ottoman form which spent its income―derived from simple money-lending and istighlÉl (purchase and lease-back) practices―on the provision of services to meet public needs or for alms-giving, the modern cash waqf invests in low return savings or is converted through the process of istibdÉl (substitution) into low-income generating assets. This conceptual paper discusses the application of certain venture capital strategies in both the investment and spending decisions of the cash waqf. In its investment decisions, the cash waqf might utilise some of the tools employed by venture capital firms for choosing its investments and for mitigating risks. In fact, there is also a possibility for the cash waqf to consider certain venture capital opportunities as an alternative asset class in which to invest a portion of its corpus. In its spending decisions, the cash waqf may choose its beneficiaries in much the same way as a venture capital firm would choose its investees; that is, by putting together a portfolio of non-profit organizations (NPOs) with proven track records for delivering social results and which are seeking to grow their organizations to achieve financial sustainability. This paper therefore proposes an Enterprise Waqf Fund (EWF) model that combines the cash waqf model with relevant concepts from venture capital to enhance the dynamism of cash waqf. Policy and legal reforms are also recommended at the end of the paper that would provide an enabling environment within which the Enterprise Waqf Fund can operate. © 2012, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

It is the development of a conceptual paper that explores and carefully reviews regulations, relevant literature studies, reports, and official documents published on the internet. The findings showed that Indonesia has successfully formulated and issued two instruments for integrating cash waqf with the State Sukuk: the CWLS and Retail CWLS. These instruments involve six state institutions and eight central socio- religious institutions that act as formulation, implementation, and supervision. Both instruments are not only beneficial for Islamic social welfare, but they also contribute to the national development. The authors argue that the innovation of Islamic financial instruments can empower the Islamic social welfare and contribute to the national development. It contributes to the discourse on cash waqf innovations in State Sukuk which studies Indonesia's experiences. This evidence from Indonesia can be adopted and applied by other countries that have fiscal limitations for the empowerment of Islamic social welfare, and at the same time contribute to the national development. © (2023), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah).

	abstract = {Limited access to financing, followed by the difficulty in the absorption of crop yields, is still a fundamental problem for farmers. This study proposes an integrated agricultural low-cost financing model based on cash waqf along with its parameters and risk mitigation. The proposed model is developed from a literature review underpinned by in-depth interviews with 17 experts (regulators, academia, and practitioners), followed by a Focus Group Discussion, and finally validated by the key experts. Findings reveal that cash waqf fund could be used as a low-cost financing with several risk mitigation procedures to finance farmers who have hardship accessing financing. Through institutional engineering, a nazhir (overseer) will involve a specialist vehicle in developing a value chain to facilitate off-takers ready to buy farmers’ crops at competitive prices. The proposed model employs Mudharaba-Salam and Ijara schemes.

	abstract = {Purpose: Productive waqf is one type of ethical business/investment, which should comply to Islamic law, with so many models to choose from. The purpose of this study is to determine factors of simple productive waqf, propose several simple productive waqf models and select the best simple productive waqf models appropriate to be adopted by waqf institution in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the analytic network process, including field survey, focused group discussion and in-depth interview, with two groups of respondents, namely, expert and waqf practitioner. Findings: The results show that the determinants of simple productive waqf in Indonesia are the waqf institution, productive waqf asset to be developed, how to finance the productive waqf, how to manage the productive waqf and the compliance of productive waqf. Proposed productive waqf models include cash-waqf and self-managed model, Islamic bank financing and self-managed model, Sukuk and external partnership model, cash-waqf and external partnership and cash-waqf + co-financing and external partnership. Moreover, the best simple productive waqf model is cash-waqf and self-managed model, followed by cash-waqf and external partnership, where they could achieve the most in all socio-economic variables, well-being compliance and moral/ethics within the theory of unity of knowledge, Tawhid. Research limitations/implications: The simple productive waqf models proposed are not exhaustive, since there are so many variations of the model. Moreover, the case and respondents are all Indonesian, so that the results are possibly only applicable to Indonesia. Practical implications: To increase the probability of successful productive waqf development, waqf institutions could apply cash-waqf and self-managed model first, while other models could be applied in staged in line with waqf institution experience. Social implications: The successful development of productive waqf could increase the social programs provided by waqf institutions to the society. Originality/value: Productive waqf development is desperately needed due to many unproductive waqf lands in Indonesia, while studies have been limited, and there is no study discussing the productive waqf model appropriate for Indonesia. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {In developed and developing nations including Malaysia, the governments provide financial assistance such as subsidies, tax deductions and financial assistance to help the households with children. However, limited government resources as well as focusing too much on economic growth in the region have restricted the assistance it can provide to the households. Thus, there are many private and charitable sources of funding that exist especially for those in need. For Muslims, there are numerous philanthropic organizations that regularly collect various charitable funds in differ ent forms, such as Zakat, Waqf, Sadaqah, and Hibah. Waqf instrument plays an important role in Muslim societies as its support the aged, the poor, the orphans through provision of education, training and business activities. Waqf institutions have managed to provide social welfare services that many current states struggle to offer. The establishment of Waqf institutions all over the Muslim world was indeed the result of worship towards Allah. This study aims to find out the permissibility of using the Waqf fund for developing of childcare facilities and the best way of its implementation. This study employs a qualitative research methodology based on deductive method of analysis of jurisprudential and literature based-evidences. The conclusion that can be drawn from this research is; Waqf for child care is permissible and can be accomplished through Waqf’s asset integration. This study also proposes the strategies of creation Waqf for childcare facilities through the modification of Waqf fund in few ways. © 2021, CA and C Press AB. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the application of Waqf in a takāful product. Waqf is a charity with special features of permanency and irrevocability which enable the benefits to be obtained by its beneficiaries across generations and centuries. This becomes possible by the transfer of property from the original owner to Allah. takāful, i.e. Islamic insurance, is a risk-management tool whereby participants donate part or all of their contributions which are used to pay claims for damages suffered by its participants. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad, which is the pioneer takāful operator in Malaysia, has combined the concept of Waqf and takāful to design and offer a takāful product known as the Takāful-Waqf Plan. This product enables young Muslims in particular to save continuously and at the same time assure their ability to establish Waqf, even if events make it impossible for them to continue contributing to the plan. Customers who participate in such a takāful plan will contribute to it regularly and, at the end of the policy, will bequest all benefits from it to appointed beneficiaries as a Waqf endowment. Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad will be the trustee who allocates the funds collected to orphanages, religious schools, mosques, and other appointed beneficiaries. Being the operator, it will also provide for the assigned sum in cases where customers may not be able to fulfil their contracted sum. However, after 7 years of operation, the plan was cancelled on 9 February 2009. However, we find that the collection of cash Waqf, managed by religious authority bodies such as Selangor State, is increasing each year. This Waqf fund that has been collected illustrates that awareness of Waqf is increasing among Muslims. This article will examine the mechanics of the plan in order to understand the reasons behind its demise. We suggest that Waqf can be integrated in the takāful policy, using different models to compare what has been implemented by the Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Berhad. © 2011 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.},

	abstract = {The Nigeria agricultural sector is faced with many predicaments, such as insufficient modern agricultural tools and facilities, loss of focus, abandonment, and inadequate motivation of farmers. In the history of Nigeria, agriculture contributed significantly to national development and poverty reduction. Such was the case before Nigeria found petroleum. The majority of Nigerian tribes were focused, committed and invested in agriculture. Poverty is rampant and common among Muslims in Nigeria especially in the northern parts of the country. Inequality and low productivity have contributed to poor standards of living in the country. The large number of Muslims in Africa, specifically the Nigeria populace, lives below $2 a day due to their abject and absolute poverty (World Bank Development Report, 2013). The Muslim community accounts for a significant number of poor and less privileged in Nigeria. Waqf assets comprise of movable and immovable properties such as cash and land. Waqf is a form of Islamic endowment that has enormous unexplored potential for its application in fulfilling social needs of the poor. One such need is for the establishment of more effective schemes to alleviate poverty among the less privileged Muslims through agribusiness that would provide enormous advantages. The objective of this paper is to examine how waqf properties can be channelled into agribusiness on cocoa, palm tree oil and cotton farm projects that will assist in empowering the needy Nigerian Muslims. The research applied both qualitative and quantitative to examine the applicability of Cash Waqf funds coupled with land for the aforementioned purpose. The study proposes strategies through which waqf properties can be used for the generation of income and reduction of poverty in Nigeria a highly populated nation. It is believed that employment opportunities will be enhanced through the proper management of such projects. © Primrose Hall Publishing Group.},

The study discussed and analyzed the structured interviews conducted on factors influencing UniSZA's staff cash waqf and its possible impact on the socio-economic development of Terengganu state. The total number of 150 respondents participated in the first instrumental validation section where 150 questionnaires were distributed and collected. One hundred and fifty questionnaires were distributed between February and June 2015 to the UniSZA's staff such as lecturer, senior, and junior staff in the university. The instrument was divided into four sections. Firstly, respondent's profile, (15 items). Secondly, factors influencing UniSZA's staff cash waqf contribution (15 items). Thirdly, promoting economic and human development (15 items). Fourthly, importance to the society development (15 items). The content validity of the questionnaire would be evaluated by the researchers to improve the questionnaire. The participants were selected from lecturers, administrative staff, and students to discover the breadth and extent of the needs for UniZSA's staff cash waqf contribution to the state. Waqf provides human relief, dignity, financial support, and social needs to reduce poverty in the society. The research is based on the hypothesis that UniSZA's staff cash waqf can have a positive social and economic impact in Terengganu.

Findings: This paper provides the conceptual framework of five models of unit trust waqf and their investment management parameters. Originality/value: The novelty of this paper lies in its attempt to highlight the importance of waqf investment strategy in ensuring sustainable returns for waqf. It does so by introducing the conceptual models of unit trust waqf as viable mechanisms to pool more cash waqf from individual investors.

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to devise policies in implementing cash waqf system of Baitul Maal wat Tamwil (BMT) in Indonesia, enabling the BMT to optimize its commercial and social activities to better achieve outreach, sustainability and welfare impact. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST) method, with three groups of knowledgeable respondents, including expert, BMT practitioner and regulator to formulate important and certain policies. Findings: The results show that four types of policies are required to improve cash waqf system of BMT, including 12 internal strategic policies, 15 internal operational policies, 15 external strategic policies and 9 external operational policies, which were found to be within a “certain planning region.” All of these policies have been agreed significantly by each group of respondents, as well as by all respondents combined. The most important-certain policies include Shiddiq, Amanah and professional Nazir, inculcate Islamic values to BMT employees and members, standard operating procedure and standard operating management of cash waqf management, technical assistance for Nazir to manage cash waqf and IT systems for BMT-cash waqf administration. Research limitations/implications: The qualitative method used has its limitations, which could be improved by incorporating other methods. Moreover, the case and respondents are all Indonesian, so that the results are possibly only applicable to BMTs in Indonesia. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt these policies in implementing their cash waqf management optimally. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help improve the social activities of the Baitul Maal directly from social cash waqf and indirectly from productive cash waqf. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study using SAST method to determine policies needed by the BMT to upgrade its cash waqf management producing more social programs for the society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This literature-normative research is qualitative with a statutory, historical, comparative, and conceptual approach. It found that first, rahmatan lil 'alamin value enables the philosophy of Islamic law to develop the Indonesian economy. The goal of Islam as a religion is to guide its believers toward the happiness of the world and the hereafter and the triangle concept among philosophy of God, human, and nature, for example, make it possible for Islamic economic with its rahmatan lil 'alamin values to cover the weakness of the conventional economic system. Second, the rahmatan lil 'alamin in Islamic economics law can be manifested by organizing social services, such as waqf, relying on the spirit of building justice in life, narrowing social gaps, as well as enlivening Islamic values.

The model is built on the basis of understanding the concept of waqf, learning from waqf institutions of the past and present and addressing specific Malaysian waqf issues. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses both primary and secondary data. The primary data originate from semi-structured interviews of waqf academicians from the Islamic economics and Islamic finance fields, waqf government officials and private sector institutions that are involved in waqf management. The secondary data come from the Malaysian Federal Constitution, law enactments, books, e-books, bulletins, journals, conference proceedings, government reports and websites. Findings: By synthesizing the data, it is found that return from cash waqf investment in unit trust can be used to finance 11 items of federal government expenditures. The overall process can be managed by Yayasan Waqaf Malaysia through a collaboration with an Islamic unit trust firm. Practical implications: This research shows how waqf can practically assist the Malaysian federal government in financing public goods and mixed public goods. It indirectly shows an alternative source of financing for these goods. Other economies can also learn and adapt from the model developed in this paper. Originality/value: This paper attempts to revive the function of waqf as a provider of public goods and mixed public goods from Islamic history. Inadvertently, this paper also introduces waqf as a possible fiscal tool. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Waqf played a powerful Islamic social finance instrument throughout Islamic history. However, the popularity of waqf declined in recent years. It is essential to understand the past research, the research gaps and the waqf’s ignorant research areas within the existing literature to enhance the waqf system. Therefore, this study aims to carry a detailed analysis of waqf research development with a careful evaluation of the scientific panorama’s different aspects inherent in Islamic business and social finance. Design/methodology/approach: Scientometrics is a discipline that studies the quantitative characteristics and characteristics of science and technological research, technology and innovation. This research’s string includes waqf as a reference in the “Article title, Abstract and Keywords” based on Scopus from 1990 to 2020. The analysis was conducted in December 2020. The Bibliometrix R Package, VOSviewer and Excel’s software are used to analyse the collected data and apply the bibliometric analysis. Findings: The findings derive that waqf research can be categorized into three sub-areas, such as the research on waqf fundamentals, analysis on cash waqf and research on various waqf applications in Islamic social finance. Even though there is some essential or fundamental research in waqf, these are not good enough for such a powerful Islamic social finance instrument. This study finds research gaps in the existing waqf literature and presents nine future research directions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to examine waqf’s existing literature with bibliometric analysis. The results and the recommended possible research areas can help scholars and researchers to carry future research to enhance the scientific development of Islamic social finance and provide alternative instruments to eradicate poverty in societies. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This paper also discusses the governance of waqf management as a source of funds for Islamic microfinance institutions (MFIs). Design/methodology/approach - This research uses content analysis method to examine various literatures that discuss the concept and management of waqf. Findings - The characteristics of cash waqf such as permanence, irrevocability and perpetuity differentiate waqf from other type of donations. Therefore, cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance needs to be sustainable. Good corporate governance is vital to ensure the sustainability. As the donors of cash waqf do not aim to make financial profit, waqf-based Islamic MFIs will be able to provide low-cost capital to the poor entrepreneurs. Furthermore, to ensure the perpetuity of the waqf, it is suggested that only revenue from the waqf property should be used for microfinance fund. Social implications - The cash waqf-based Islamic microfinance will help the micro entrepreneurs to get low-cost capital without collateral. At the same time, public can donate any amount they afford to contribute to cash waqf. Originality/value - The creation of a cash waqf-based Islamic MFI must observe the issues of agency conflicts and the right of stakeholders to a transparent management. This paper emphasizes the importance of good governance in managing the waqf property as a source of fund for Islamic MFIs. © Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Findings: The results of exploratory factor analysis indicate strong constructs nomological validity. The structural equation modelling using path analysis was also performed to estimate the proposed research framework. The result of model testing shows significant relationship between perceived ihsan, Islamic egalitarian and Islamic religiosity on cash waqf contribution. Practical implications: The results suggest that perception of ihsan and notion of equality significantly influences Muslims’ sense of religiosity, which subsequently encourages the generosity giving behaviour of waqf. Implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are also discussed. Originality/value: The study introduces two new dimensions of perceived ihsan and Islamic egalitarian.

The value and importance of waqf endowment cannot be under estimated and ignored. Cash waqf is a modern financial instrument for socio-economic development in solving social issues and challenges confronting Muslims globally. The study adopts a library method to reach solutions to outstanding problems.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively discuss the issue of risk vis-à-vis the perpetuity restriction principle inherent in waqf (Islamic endowment). Specifically, it attempts to consolidate the axioms in both conventional and Islamic finance, such as the risk-return trade-off and al-ghunm bi al-ghurm (liability accompanies gain), with the perpetual nature of waqf. Overall, this paper attempts to find a resolution to the dilemma of perpetuity restriction inherent in cash waqf against the natural occurrence of the risk. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the secondary research methodology; past literature encompassing journal articles, books, relevant financial axioms, fatwas (Islamic rulings) and state enactments is critically reviewed to present its case. In regard to state enactments, only Malaysian state enactments have been used, thus restricting the study to the Malaysian case only. Findings: This study contends that the dilemma of the perpetuity restriction and the natural occurrence of risk can be resolved through the integration of waqf risk management, especially concerning cash waqf, with the Islamic spiritual approach. By implementing standard operating procedures that inculcate awareness on waqf risk management and Islamic spirituality in waqf stakeholders (wāqif (donor), trustee and beneficiaries), the stakeholders may accept the reality of risk that is inevitable even after all efforts have been exhausted. In other words, the violation of perpetuity is exonerated given that mental faculties aligned with revealed texts have been exhaustively used beforehand. Practical implications: Findings from this study may broaden the choice of investment avenues for waqf trustees while adhering to the perpetual restriction of waqf. More importantly, waqf trustees will not be forced to invest in interest-bearing securities or be involved in any usurious transactions just to obtain guaranteed returns and preserve the corpus of waqf. Originality/value: This study offers a unique perspective on cash waqf risk management by re-analyzing the axioms and concepts of finance and waqf while observing the welfare of the beneficiaries. © 2021, Azniza Hartini Azrai Azaimi Ambrose and Fadhilah Abdullah Asuhaimi.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a model for a cash waqf bank, called a tazkiah bank―based on crowdfunding, endowment, and the global mobilisation of business through savings and investments―that reinforces societal values and stimulates civil society at the grassroots level. A tazkiah bank is defined as an independent institution that collects funds from donors or endowment contributors (whether institutions or individuals), then routes them to viable, productive, for-profit investments that contribute to economic development and encourage social responsibility. Web-based technology related to social networking would play a key role in the development of tazkiah banks as they would take advantage of feedback and readily available knowledge from various communities in order to gain diverse information that determines which or how projects receive funding and the size of the funds needed. This model aims to promote sustainable economic development by incorporating features that can overcome the shortcomings of traditional Islamic banks and endowment institutions. The success of the tazkiah bank model requires long-term strategies. This paper seeks to explore alternatives by applying Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) methodology to this model in order to delve beneath the superficial signs of issues to explore underpinning systems, structures, and worldviews. To do so, it moves through the four levels of CLA from the most visible (the empirical litany) to the least visible (the realm of myths and metaphors). © 2015, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

Data were analysed using descriptive and hypothesis testing method by using of multiple regression. The study found that respondents’ understanding and religiosity are the significant factors that influenced them to contribute to cash waqf.

	abstract = {Islam guides us in poverty alleviation based on the principles of justice and equitable distribution of wealth. Islam provides practical guidelines for economic problems through both market and non-market mechanisms. Islamic finance provides a model that identifies individual differences among people not only from the perspective of equitable opportunities for all but also from providing other means for addressing economic problems. This presentation takes a deep dive into "Waqf" as a rewarding economic system. I present an alternative view of Waqf integrating it as a component of the traditional economic system. I explain how Waqf increases aggregate consumption, expenditure, and expand national income. A cross-country review of current state of Waqf practices is included for comparative analysis. It helps to grasp a complete understanding of challenges and issues in Waqf globally. Lack of trust in Waqf managers and institutions is the key factor why, despite being the best social capital model, the practice of Waqf is relatively low in Muslim majority countries. Evidence is there that in many cases financial greed takes over the financial objective creating a fear of permanent loss among the endowers. Moreover, investments of Waqf fund are not well diversified and not invested properly to generate income to support waqf assets. To get the most out of Waqf asset, strategic alignments of Waqf funds and stakeholders are necessary at the institutional level. In the final section of this presentation, I suggest a comprehensive legal framework that adequately addresses major financial, agency, and governance issues pertaining to Waqf. A Waqf friendly legal environment coupled with preferential tax treatment for the endowed funds is crucial in achieving the intended goal of Islamic finance through Waqf as its vehicle. © 2018, Islamic Bank Training and Research Academy.},

Waqf Fund Scheme was established by the Islamic Religious Council of Penang, Majlis Agama Islam Negeri Pulau Pinang (MAINPP), in an effort to develop the economy of the Muslim community in the state. Design/methodology/approach: This study analysed the contribution that this endowment fund makes towards a comprehensive scheme of economic development, namely, in terms of the economic, spiritual and social welfare of the Muslim community in Penang. The primary source of data was obtained through interviews conducted by the researcher with the Manager of the Waqf Fund Scheme, the Head of Administration and Finance Section and the Account Executive of MAINPP. The researcher also interviewed respondents from four institutions that were beneficiaries of the Waqf Fund Scheme. Findings: The findings of this research show that the endowment fund scheme plays an important role in the economic development of the Muslim community in Penang. The Waqf Fund Scheme contributes by way of providing a financing facility towards the acquisition of waqf assets or through cash support channelled to associations or committees of a masjid. Research limitations/implications: This study only focuses on Waqf Fund Scheme which was established by MAINPP.

In an attempt to fill this gap in this study, data elicited from respondents via an adopted survey instrument was subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The results indicated that the awareness level is still low and that social culture, lack of promotion, and lack of understanding statistically and significantly explain the level of awareness and application about Cash Waqf among the respondents. Recommendations contingent on research findings were offered. Copyright © IIUM Press.},

His unique perspective on Islamic approaches to consumption, production, and distribution, as well as the state's role and the social security system in an Islamic economy, enriched theoretical knowledge in Islamic economics. In addition, as a visionary, lifelong educator, and philanthropist, he left his mark by establishing several institutions, including the Social Islami Bank Limited (SIBL), which continue to contribute to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh. He dedicated his talent and hard work to establishing SIBL to test his three-sector model (formal, informal, and voluntary) of reducing poverty and inequality in society.

	abstract = {Purpose: Waqf (Islamic endowment) in the form of cash is important to address the problem of developing idle waqf lands. Although there are various existing models of cash waqf, there is still a need for innovative cash waqf models. This paper aims to offer an alternative mode of financing for developing idle waqf lands using the concepts of cooperatives and waqf. Design/methodology/approach: The present study first evaluates relevant literature on financing issues faced by waqf institutions in developing idle waqf lands as well as existing models of cash waqf. Based on the prevailing gap in cash waqf models, the study proposes a hybrid model of cooperative-waqf to finance idle waqf lands in Malaysia. Findings: The proposed model is unique owing to the new dimension of membership being embedded into the waqf project. It considers donors as members of the waqf project, which is funded through the cash waqf collected, and thus, donors are given the privilege to receive benefits from the commercialised projects that are developed on the waqf lands. The existing models of cash waqf use traditional methods in which donors merely contribute cash waqf without any awareness of how the contributions are utilised. Usually, this problem occurs due to the lack of reciprocal communication between cash waqf donors and waqf institutions. Research limitations/implications: The present study examines the case of waqf land development in the context of Malaysia only. Secondly, the paper does not contain any empirical analysis, and the development of the paper is based on existing literature that discusses various models of cash waqf practised in Muslim-majority and -minority countries. Future research can conduct surveys of donors and other stakeholders on the practicality of the model. Practical implications: It is expected that the proposed cooperative-waqf model will be able to create a synchronised relationship between cash waqf donors and waqf institutions and hence boost participation in developing waqf lands. Originality/value: The present study adds to the existing literature in the area of waqf and cash waqf models, especially the application of this instrument in the context of Malaysia. It also offers a new hybrid model to the State Islamic Religious Councils (SIRCs) – Malaysia’s sole trustee of waqf assets management – such that the implementation of the proposed model could boost the collection of cash waqf in developing commercial projects on idle waqf lands. © 2018, Anwar Allah Pitchay, Mohamed Asmy Mohd Thas Thaker, Al Amin Mydin, Zubir Azhar and Abdul Rais Abdul Latiff.},

	abstract = {Waqf is an Islamic asset endowment to be kept in faith and used for charitable or religious purposes. Its function is to demonstrate the potential and economic benefits of waqf assets for worship and other people’s prosperity. Indonesia has great opportunities to raise more significant amounts of waqf funds. One strategy that appears effective with regard to waqf, especially cash waqf, is to provide an online service. Hence, this research attempts to analyse whether the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived religiosity, and amount of information influences user acceptance of using an online waqf application process by implementing the technology acceptance model (TAM). Moreover, the study incorporates structural equation modelling (SEM) to interpret the path analysis of the model. The study fills the gap in the literature concerning the context of use of the technology acceptance model for online waqf applications in Indonesia. We find that the variables that directly influence user acceptance of online waqf application are perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, with perceived ease of use influencing perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease of use is influenced by the amount of information. Furthermore, the majority of respondents prefer to have projects such as mosques, Islamic boarding schools, schools, and hospital construction projects. To increase user acceptance, online waqf developers should provide more information about the application process and develop more user-friendly software with many features. Moreover, regulators should provide incentives for online waqf developers to maximise cash waqf collection. © Islamic Monetary Economics and Finance. All rights reserved.},

Design/methodology/approach: An adapted questionnaire with 26 items was administered to 382 academic and supporting staffs, postgraduate and undergraduate students in three states in Malaysia. The data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis with SPSS 21 and AMOS 21, respectively. Findings: The results further support the parsimonious nature theory of planned behavior (TPB) with its three original construct of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control and an additional construct of perceived cost advantages of the CWFCMM Model. A validated TPB scale with 24 items measured can be proposed to be used as an evaluative tool to assess the level to which the homeowners are interested to participate in the CWFCMM Model. Research limitations/implications: The modified TPB scale would also facilitate the identifications of factors that influence homeowners’ intention to opt for Islamic home financing (IHF) by non-bank Islamic financial institutions such as financial cooperative. Practical implications: The CWFCMM Model aims to harness the potential synergy between third-sector economy players such as waqf and financial cooperatives in offering affordable IHF solution to potential homeowners. Social implications: The CWFCMM Model may enable the Malaysian homeowners to enjoy a more affordable IHF solution, thereby, among others, reducing the purchase and monthly repayment affordability of Malaysians. Originality/value: There is a dearth of Islamic financial services selection studies, especially within the non-banking, Islamic financial services milieu. The CWFCMM Model, which has been developed by the authors, enriches the limited literature on this subject matter. It will also add value to understand how the customers would react to an alternative IHF provider. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The results of the analysis show that all the variables, namely religious adherence, benevolence, familiarity with the waqf institution, and trust in the waqf institution significantly influence the behaviour of repeated cash waqf contributions.

	abstract = {Waqf is an act of holding certain property and preserving it for the confined benefit of certain philanthropy that disallows any use or disposition of it outside the specific objective. Waqf creates great benefits not only for the donor (known as waqif) but also for the whole society. Study on the involvement of the Muslim community in waqf is limited but very instrumental in the economic development of Muslims. This study aims to determine the roles of religiosity, attitude, and trust on awaqf institution in determining waqif’s satisfaction in endowing cash waqf that leads to waqif’s intention to endow cash waqf. A total of 193 respondents participated in the study. Findings showed that religiosity, attitude and trust on awqaf institution are important factors in determining waqif’s satisfaction that leads to waqif’s intention to endow cash waqf. The study provides a useful source of information, which can be used by awqaf institutions regarding targeting Muslim participation in cash waqf. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to propose cash waqf (endowment) to develop a conceptual model that can be utilised to extend microfinance for refugees. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative method is used in this research. An extensive review of the literature has been conducted. Latest literature on refugees, microfinance has been critically examined beside the current cash waqf models. Findings: Empirical studies have shown that many refugees are equipped with marketable skills and talents that can be utilised to improve their socio-economic situations. The proposed model – cash waqf refugee microfinance fund (CWRMF) – is structured to extend microfinance to potential refugee micro entrepreneurs. To address the lack of collateral, which is a requirement to gain any microfinance, CWRMF has been incorporated with a takaful unit (cooperation) by which refugees may guarantee each other. Additionally, the model has also been structured to address the challenge of sustainability of the institution that would provide microfinance. Hence, a reserve fund has also been integrated into the model. Practical implications: CWRMF represents a potential model to be implemented by humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and aid agencies to support livelihood of refugees in particular for Muslim refugees. Positive outcome is expected from the implementation of this model. This is because of the various advantages of microfinance programs not only on refugees but also on concerned NGOs, host populations and donor parties. Additionally, this paper is a set of primarily thoughts aims to open the door wider for more researchers to explore the potential of cash waqf as one of the instruments to finance refugee microenterprises and business activities. Originality/value: Recently cash waqf has been into several models for socio-economic development and poverty alleviation. This paper is proposing cash waqf as a source for a microfinance fund that can contribute in the improvement of socio-economic situations of millions of refugees around the world. © 2017, Omar Ahmad Kachkar.},

The sample consisted of 430 Malays respondents residing in Selangor. The study used the methodology of Baron and Kenny for mediation analysis. Findings: The finding indicates that Malays do hold sympathies towards the poor. Further investigation shows that high-income class and female are the two demographic groups that are more sympathetic towards the poor because of their strong belief in charity. Research limitations/implications: The data collection is limited to Selangor only. However, it provides enough information about the demographic groups which is worth exploring for the future researchers in order to come up with marketing strategies related to cash waqf collections. Practical implications: On the basis of findings, cash waqf institutions in Malaysia can come up with marketing strategies to attract high-income class and females as their potential donors.

This study investigates public intention to participate in Retail CWLS (SWR) using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) framework with the addition of other relevant constructs. An online survey was conducted using the purposive sampling technique and involved 130 respondents. The data were analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) supported by WarpPLS. The results indicate that Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Transparency (PT), and Trust in the Indonesian Waqf Board and Waqf Institutions have a significant positive effect on individual Intention to participate in Retail CWLS. Furthermore, this study reveals that Trust could partially mediate the relationship between PU and individual Intention. However, Religiosity fails to moderate the relationship between PU and individual Intention to purchase SWR. The study also demonstrated other complementary statistical outputs such as splitsample, non-linear relationships among latent variables, effect size, and the Q-squared coefficient to ensure that the processed data were robust. Also, this finding indirectly implies that CWLS is not only targeted at the Muslim community but also for general investors from other religions and beliefs. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

	abstract = {Islamic charitable innovations have evolved to give rise to the integration between Sukuk and cash waqf called Cash Waqf Linked Sukuk (CWLS). The integration of these two things is promising when combined, considering that Sukuk has long been named a commercial sharia instrument that aims to raise funds, while cash waqf as a sharia social instrument has played a philanthropic role. As for Indonesia, the cash waqf combined with Sukuk has become a new fiscal instrument because it has advantages in addition to contributing to development, furthermore, the returns obtained are reused into waqf money for socio-economic projects and funds invested be returned at maturity. As legal research, this article uses qualitative analysis with statutory approaches and conceptual approaches. This article intends to introduce a new conceptual framework model innovation between CWLS and fintech types of Islamic securities crowdfunding. This innovation is for no reason considering that the use of fintech types of Islamic securities crowdfunding makes CWLS more popular and more flexible so that the funds raised are expected to be larger and can reach the broader community for the construction of more massive socio-economic projects. Furthermore, this article provides an overview of the proposed innovations in achieving the goals of maqasid al-shariah, regulations, and opportunities and challenges to be implemented in Indonesia. © 2023 - Imtiyaz Wizni Aufa, Anugrah Muhtarom Pratama, and Umi Khaerah Pati.},

By using a qualitative approach, this study f ound that the cash waqf movement can restore the role and position of high-inherited wealth in Minangkabau in the following forms; first, reclaiming the pawned assets and increase the number of assets through the cash waqf movement from all members of the tribe or clan. Second, legalizing these assets by changing the certificate into waqf property certificate. Third, managing the high-inherited assets productively and sharing the profits for the economic needs and welfare of the people or tribe. Assets management and development through the cash waqf movement can be used as a model for other communities, especially the Minangkabau community in managing people’s or tribal assets and improving the welfare of the people. © 2022, Institut Agama Islam Negeri Batusangkar.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a framework based on the theory of planned behavior, primary data was collected from 418 Muslim millennials who domiciled in large cities in Indonesia and subsequently analyzed using the structural equation modeling method. Findings: The main findings suggest that knowledge, trust and religiosity play a positive role in explaining the intention to donate cash waqf online among Indonesia’s millennials. Religiosity is found to be the most powerful factor in influencing attitude, while knowledge is the least significant factor influencing the attitude, which subsequently influences the intention to engage in online cash waqf. Social norms and perceived behavioral control are also positively influencing such intention. Practical implications: These results imply that it is important for waqf institutions to reflect strong Islamic values in their cash waqf products and to more strongly communicate religious messages about the benefits of giving cash waqf to the millennials. It is also crucial to increase waqf literacy through appropriate campaigns. Moreover, they need to be more transparent and accountable to establish, maintain and enhance trust in their organizations.

Endowment of waqf is generally known in terms of porperty but little attention given to endowment of cash waqf. This paper aims to investigate antecedents and consequences of Muslim attitude towards participation in cash waqf in Malaysia. The findings of this paper are based on 386 samples. Descriptive analysis, exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis are used to analyse the data. The results indicate that individual religiosity, trust in awqaf institutions and convenience to endow are antecedents of Muslim attitude towards participation in cash waqf, which consequently leads to individual intention to participate in the practice. The study provides a useful source of information to related parties for instance the waqf institution and Islamic regulatory body in executing effective startegy to promote cash waqf as well as reinforcement of systematic collection procedures that can benefit the community. © 2017, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

Its combined flexibility and accuracy is important to the real purpose of the waqf in its implementation. Its dynamics are first explored through its meaning and objectives as well as special features of waqf and cash waqf with special focus on the status of the endowed asset (mawquf). The second part focuses on the critical evaluation of the current cash waqf practices in Malaysia. It is found that the special attention on the endowed asset ought to be maintained in order to preserve its original purpose. Waqf offers all kinds of assistance and is not confined to crisis management. Possessing the highest liquidity rate, cash waqf constitutes an important financial mechanism, especially given the current state of economic affairs. Its nature must be maintained, as suggested by those jurists who allow cash to be considered as an endowed asset (mawquf) and also those who do not favour it, in order to maintain the perpetuity of the benefit. Only by adhering to this special arrangement, the real spirit of waqf and its dynamics can be preserved and further developed in order to fulfil the economic needs of society. © 2018 International Islamic University Malaysia.

	abstract = {A principal pillar of the Ottoman juridical system, the shari'a constituted the legal basis of an Ottoman monarch’s sovereignty, a source of legitimacy for the Ottoman dynasty, and a component of the Ottoman discourse on legitimacy. In light of these considerations, a particularly resilient brand of scholarship has praised Ottoman monarchs as promulgators and protectors of Islamic orthodoxy, depicted the Ottoman polity as an Islamic empire ruled in strict adherence to God’s law, and thus characterized the Ottoman enterprise fundamentally as an “empire of faith.” Intended as a historiographical intervention contra this strand of scholarship, the current essay aims to demonstrate that Ottoman sultans, statesmen, and scholars frequently prioritized the needs of their “state” over the principles of their “faith” by highlighting the dubious jurisprudential legitimacy of three quintessentially Ottoman institutions: the practice of fratricide, the levy of Christian children, and the establishment of pious endowments with money. It argues that the prevalence of such practices definitively demonstrates that for Ottoman imperial elites, Islamic law was not an end but rather a means to an end—and that end comprised the preservation and strengthening of an increasingly centralized early modern empire.

	abstract = {Waqf company is a new concept in the waqf. It is different from the conventional waqf that is based on real estate and plantations. It is also different from the cash waqf. Due to this, the purpose of this paper is to study the concept of waqf company, try to define it, and establish how it works through the use of the Saudi Arabian practice as a reference point. This research adopted a qualitative research method, using content analysis of the secondary literature from both classical and contemporary jurists and legal experts’ opinions. Some of the major findings are the definition of a waqf company whose shares are all waqf. It also found that a company does not become a waqf company because of having few shares declared as waqf by their owners. In terms of incorporation, waqf company can take any form of business entity that could be used as a vehicle for commercial activities. The limitation of the research is that there is little literature because the topic is still new. The research presents a practicable concept of the waqf company. To prove this, there is a need to establish a business entity so that the assets and the shares are declared as waqf so that the dividends will be benefiting the designated beneficiaries. The research has a social implication, considering waqf as an Islamic social fund. It will help policymakers further push for adequate laws and regulations that will strengthen the operationality and efficiency of waqf company, thereby significantly reducing poverty and creating jobs through employment by the waqf company. The research is one of the few research pieces that have been conducted in this field as there is a shortage of literature till the current time. Thus, the research will contribute to the efforts being asserted towards understanding the concept of waqf company. صخلم. © 2020, Statistical Economic and Social Research and. All rights reserved.},

Findings – The concept of cash waqf could be used for the operation of a waqf bank. There was a tendency among the given group of practitioners towards a corporate international social bank, capitalised by the waqf and non-waqf assets, sought after from the public and private sectors, as well as the Muslims and non-Muslims. Research limitations/implications – Assumptions are basic. Empirical findings are based on the perspective of waqf trustees. Other stakeholders’ perspectives need further research. Practical implications – The study is expected to persuade for, and assist in the establishment of a waqf bank. Social implications – This paper could contribute to the effectiveness of waqf institutions in their delivery of public good to the poor and society. These implications are not restricted to a specific country. Charities and the poor of any society may benefit from this study if the idea of total social banking is upheld.

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore the awareness and willingness level of millennials in Indonesia towards cash waqf (cash endowment). Cash waqf has gained huge attention in Indonesia because of its flexibility, especially after the Majlis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) officially announcing in 2002 that cash waqf practices in the country are Sharīʿah-compliant. Millennials comprise 33.75% of the total Indonesian population. Therefore, it is vital to analyze cash waqf from an Indonesian perspective. This study provides vital information for all institutions that are concerned with the enhancement of cash waqf contributions in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach: Self-structured questionnaires were distributed in Java Island to collect the data. The data were examined by employing suitable statistical tools. Besides, post-interview fact-finding was conducted with cash waqf experts from different related institutions in Indonesia to reach a more in-depth understanding about cash waqf issues. Findings: The results depict a high level of awareness about cash waqf among millennials in Indonesia. The results further reveal a lower willingness level to contribute to cash waqf of the sample population as compared to their level of awareness about cash waqf. Moreover, cash waqf promotions must focus on delivering a deeper understanding about the concept and how it differs from other types of Islamic philanthropy. The results suggest that waqf trustees in the country must be more transparent. Moreover, the Indonesian Waqf Board should implement stricter rules to monitor waqf trustees. Research limitations/implications: This research restricts the sample population to Indonesian Muslims who were born between 1980 and 2000. Practical implications: As a Muslim-majority country, one would expect Indonesia to make much progress in cash waqf. By providing an explanatory understanding of willingness and awareness of cash waqf among Indonesians, this research can be helpful in designing proper educative marketing campaigns for future endowers to cash waqf activities to ensure cash waqf institutions provide efficient services. It is advisable to emphasize the transparency of waqf organizations. This will add to the nāz˙irs’ (waqf trustee) reputation, thereby boosting waqf's national shares by ensuring a proper allocation of cash waqf. The regulator should be more strict in monitoring nāz˙ir practices. For instance, it could include a periodic assessment of waqf entities. Originality/value: This study is original in nature; there is no previous study that addresses the millennial’s perspective toward cash waqf in Indonesia. Hence, this study presents precious information for policy makers, practitioners and researchers. © 2021, Khaled Nour Aldeen, Inayah Swasti Ratih and Risa Sari Pertiwi.},

	abstract = {Muslim societies and communities in all Islamic countries and most of the other regions of the world are having awqaf properties inherited from their ancestors. However, presently the waqf properties are passing through a trend characterized by usurpation, neglect and unproductive use. Prof Khalid Rashid in his lead paper has rightly emphasized need to protect and develop the existing awqaf and to consider certain measures which may enhance the income generation capability and administrative well-being of awqaf. Thus, a reform of the waqf system in the contemporary Islamic world is absolutely necessary. In a post-economic and financial liberalization environment at the global level, it is important to utilize awqaf for poverty reduction, capacity building and economic empowerment of Muslim communities. The waqf fund can be channeled through educational, social and cultural development. In this context, this paper discusses that in modern times, the economic dimensions of waqf institution need attention of scholars and economists to explore its potential role in economic life of Muslims. In a country like India waqf institutions have been playing a very significant role and have still great potentiality to do so in the religious, social and economic life of Muslims. However, they need to be cleansed of corruption and mismanagement. The control by government organization and the state interference sometimes pose another problem in the way of proper utilization of the awqaf properties in an effective way. © 2018, JKAU: Islamic Econ.},

Perceived ease of use (PEU) is found as the most significant predictor of perceived usefulness (PU). Both generate a significant effect on Muslim youths’ attitudes toward DSBS. Overall, subjective norm (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), PU and attitudes are important determinants that lead individual decisions to use the online cash-waqf payment through DSBS. Finally, the research findings conclude that DSBS plays a significant role in encouraging the interest of young Muslim generations to participate in cash-waqf transactions. Originality/value: This study seeks to contribute to the existing literature by enriching the discussion on DSBS’s service, especially in the context of optimizing the collection of Islamic Philanthropy through cash-waqf transaction. Also, this study integrates theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) into a single research model to explore the determinants of cash-waqf participation in digital era. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

While a high volume of literary evidence on this Islamic social finance instrument is available, the research motivation and study findings are diverse. Therefore, we conduct a bibliometric analysis of waqf literature to understand the pattern and direction of research on Waqf broadly. We collect 319 articles, and reviews on Waqf extracted from the Scopus database, covering a period exceeding 100 years from 1914 until June 2020. We employ RStudio, VOSviewer, and Microsoft Excel for citation analysis, content, and network analyses. A systematic review of recent publications complemented the bibliometric analysis. Alongside revealing the most relevant scientific actors in waqf literature, most researchers on Waqf were from Malaysia; they conducted studies widely on cash Waqf. As a result, we identify four research themes for waqf studies which include (1) Cash Waqf endowment, (2) Islamic accountability and Waqf, (3) Waqf and Islamic social finance, and (4) Governance for Waqf endowment. This is the first study to provide a bibliometric review of waqf literature to address gaps in the existing research and offer directions for future research which could benefit early-career Islamic finance researchers. © 2021, Eurasia Business and Economics Society.},

This institution experienced many obstacles because cash waqf is a new thing in society. People's understanding of waqf objects so far is in the form of objects that are not used up. This study aimed to explore the West Sumatra Muhammadiyah cash waqf's productivity to develop sharia investment and micro, small and medium enterprises in Padang. This research is a field research study with a qualitative approach. The data is in the form of primary data obtained through in-depth interviews with selected informants through snowball sampling—secondary data as supporting data to complete information and theory about cash waqf. Data analysis used an interactive model of qualitative analysis with data reduction, data presentation, verification, and conclusion. The findings of this study indicate that the productivity of cash waqf carried out by the West Sumatra Muhammadiyah Cash Waqf Board is in the form of capital investment and work (business). However, development in the form of work or business has not been fully implemented. This is not due to constraints in development efforts but in the productivity of micro and small businesses caused by unprofessional management and the lack of other development models that are more appropriate to make the business productive for each of the various productive investment units. Investments that are made and can produce waqf funds are more in the form of capital investment than work investment. © 2022, Jurnal Ilmiah Al-Syir’h.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study applies the qualitative content analysis method, guided by a model of composite approaches of poverty alleviation in Islam, integrated Islamic commercial and social finance (IICSF) and crisis management of Umar bin Khattab, to construct various programs and/or policy actions toward economic recovery in Indonesia. Findings: The results show that ISF with its instruments, especially zakat, infaq and waqf could help the government and the economy to recover from the crisis. The proposed solutions include: save lives, including medical assistance using zakat-infaq and health-care waqf using waqf; save households, by creating a social safety net and graduation program using zakat-infaq; save businesses, especially micro-small enterprises (MSEs), through financial and business assistance (especially digital marketing) leveraging zakat-infaq-waqf and save financial institutions, especially micro-small financial institutions, by the development of cash waqf and the adoption of fintech and IICSF, especially in Islamic financial institutions targeting MSEs. Research limitations/implications: This study is exploratory in nature, which needs further investigations using more sophisticated qualitative and/or quantitative methods. Practical implications: If the above programs using ISF instruments are implemented, the economic surplus would be re-established and the acceleration of economic recovery can be realized. Social implications: The successful adoption of ISF could at the same time reduce poverty, accelerate MSEs development and improve equitable well-being.

	abstract = {Purpose: Baitul Maal wa Tamwil (BMT) is an Islamic microfinance institution created by combining the functionality of Baitul Maal and Baitul Tamwil in Indonesia. While Baitul Maal plays the role of an institution that collects funds from zakah, cash waqf, infaq and sadakah, Baitul Tamwil then distributes these funds in the form of Qardhul Hassan financing to the poor at the bottom of the economic pyramid (BOP). This study aims to explain the poverty alleviation effort by BMT regarding its role in providing Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP and provide practical suggestions to maximize the outreach performance of the BMT. Design/methodology/approach: In this methodology, the study adopts the qualitative analysis of reviewing the literature and interviewing the BMT staff in Jakarta, Makassar and Nusa Tenggara Barat areas to present the views of the practitioners related to the role of Baitul Maal in giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP using appreciative intelligence framework. Findings: The study finds that BMT in Indonesia needs several stage-specific structures and roles to be effective. In particular, there is a need to separate the function of Baitul Maal from Baitul Tamwil to enhance its role when giving Qardhul Hassan financing to the people at the BOP. The role of Baitul Maal in alleviating the poverty figure is also drawn in this study. Originality/value: The findings of this study add to the literature on Baitul Maal by enabling researchers and practitioners to appreciate the role of Baitul Maal, and these findings also contribute towards enriching the knowledge in Baitul Maal and financing requirements of the poor at the BOP. This paper also contributes to the field of Islamic accounting which is currently getting prominent. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper for the development of the ICWME-I model. It is purely qualitative in nature, using content analysis. It comprehensively reviews the literature related to HCD issues faced by micro enterprises and existing studies related to cash waqf (Islamic endowment) to construct the ICWME-I model. Findings: The proposed ICWME-I model is specially designed for HCD of micro enterprises. It is an appropriate initiative to upgrade micro enterprises through HCD programmes by ensuring proper utilization of cash waqf funds to build modern training centres at subsidized costs with state-of-the-art facilities. The training centres would subsidize the participation fees of micro enterprises and provide them with facilities to undertake education and training programmes, as well as other kinds of activities for upgrading, improving and enhancing human capital capacity and skills of micro enterprises. The potential challenges of the ICWME-I model are also highlighted in this study. Research limitations/implications: This paper attempts to construct the ICWME-I model based on an extensive review of literature related to micro enterprises, cash waqf and HCD. Among its major limitations is the fact that the ICWME-I model is not empirically validated and tested in this research. This can be carried out in future studies. Practical implications: The present study could have an enormous impact on micro entrepreneurs via HCD programmes. The most important impact would be on government budgets, as this ICWME-I model is expected to generate its own funds from cash waqf for micro enterprises’ HCD.

This research supports the conclusion that the rise of monetization in the economy prompted the rapid emergence of cash waqf endowments and led the administrators of such pious institutions to become personally involved in moneylending activities. Through an investigation of Khivan qāżī records, this article shows how cash waqf capital was utilized through bay'-i jāiz, a type of moneylending agreement that became popular across much of the 19th-century Islamic world. It argues that the emergence of cash waqf and bay-i jāiz agreements during this period is indicative of the influences of global industrial capitalism on the Khivan economy.

We also examine the participation of different groups—namely, officials (askeri), civilians (reaya), and women— as cash-waqf founders. We find that women were significant contributors to the waqf sector and that, contrary to a common assumption in the literature, officials’ participation as benefactors was proportional to that of other groups. Furthermore, we show that the relative shares of social groups as benefactors in the waqf sector f luctuated significantly over time.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to attempt to offer a viable alternative model of source of financing to develop waqf land, which is known as crowdfunding-waqf model (CWM). Design/methodology/approach: The extant literature on the financing constraints faced by waqf institution in developing waqf land, and crowdfunding have been reviewed critically and used in the attempt of proposing an alternative model. Findings: The paper has developed CWM as a source of financing for waqf institution in Malaysia. This model is expected to provide waqf institution in Malaysia to meet their liquidity constraint in developing waqf land. It also involves an involvement of crowdfunding platform. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on conceptual explorations of literature in the area of waqf and crowdfunding. This is a conceptual paper, so it did not use any empirical analysis. Practical implications: The findings of this paper will provide waqf institution with an alternative source of financing to develop waqf land. The present study also has implications for government and policymakers. By involving crowdfunding, it helps the government to reduce its expenses for the development of waqf land in Malaysia. Originality/value: This paper offers an additional literature on waqf and crowdfunding especially from the Malaysian context. The paper proposes a viable alternative model for waqf institution as a source of financing by using crowdfunding, to develop waqf land. This model incorporates donation-based crowdfunding model and reward-based crowdfunding model. This model is different with the existing way of raising Cash waqf, which is conducted also via online basis by financial institutions and state government agencies. Later, the collected Cash waqf fund is transformed into illiquid assets such as building of hospitals, educational institutions and purchasing machinery and assets. However, the nature of proposed model in this study is to assist waqf institution to develop waqf land. Crowdfunding model is used to raise fund to develop waqf land in Malaysia. The fund collected via crowdfunding model is based on donation and reward based, not based on the nature of Cash waqf. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

We use Key Mediating Variables (KMV) Theory with variables such as board benevolence, board integrity, board ability, board opportunism, communication, and accountability to predict the trust and commitment of civil servants in providing cash waqf. Research design, data and methodology: We used a quantitative research approach and an online questionnaire distributed to civil servants in Gorontalo Province; 410 respondents were obtained. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used, utilizing the SEM-PLS software to analyze the data. Result: This study found that the variables board benevolence, board ability, board integrity, board opportunism, communication, and accountability affected trust. As for the variable of accountability, the hypothesis was rejected Conclusion: The communication variable of cash waqf institutions has a strong influence in increasing the confidence of civil servants in providing cash endowments. However, trust in waqf institutions may diminish due to low accountability and poor governance of cash waqf institutions. The trust of civil servants in cash waqf institutions in the future will increase their commitment to waqf. © Copyright: The Author(s)},

According to Islamic law, a Waqf property is permanently dedicated to Allah Almighty and is to be used, as specified by the waqif (the endower), for permissible purposes. India and Malaysia, two countries of unique importance to the Muslim world, have an enormous number of Waqf properties. This study explores immovable Waqf, rather than movable and cash Waqf assets. The huge Waqf properties have significantly supported the development of the economic and social order of the Muslim community in the past. However, it is widely believed that due to inefficient governance and mismanagement, Waqf assets in both countries have not been optimally utilized for the betterment of local Muslim societies. This comparative study attempts to analyze the governance of Waqf institutions in India and Malaysia in the past and present, so as to highlight the main issues pertaining to governance. This will help each country to look at their respective merits and demerits and to learn from each other's governance model.

We find religious motive to be the strongest motivation for charitable giving and it does not conflict with humanistic motive. The respondents identify that lack of trust, small size of donations, inability to verify activities of charities and difficulty in ensuring privacy are the major obstacles in charitable giving. We recommend that Cash Waqf can provide an effective basis of channelizing charitable funds in the private non-profit sector given the high prevalence of voluntary giving in the form of cash throughout the year and the existing trust deficit between people and the public Zakat agency. © 2018, Islamic Bank Training and Research Academy.},

Baitulmaal Munzalan Indonesia Foundation (BMI) is present as one solution for people who want to donate their fund’s waqf through money in the industrial revolution 4.0 era. Having only been established for three years, BMI has managed to raise funds cash waqf of Rp. 2.9 billion. This paper aims to explain the strategies and constraints faced by BMI in collecting endowment funds through money in the digital age. By using the type of field research and data collection techniques through observation, interviews, and Focus Grup Discussion (FGD), there are two research results in this paper. First, the strategies used by BMI in developing cash waqf in the digital age are companies through social media (Facebook pages and Instagram) and tablig. Kampanye through social media is the most dominant strategy used by BMI and has enormous potential. Secondly, the obstacle felt by BMI in managing and developing cash waqf is negative perceptions from the community (external obstacle). Based on the results of this study, the authors argue that marketing through social media not only has positive implications for-profit institutions but also non-profit institutions such as BMI in collecting and managing cash waqf in Indonesia. © 2020,Ijtihad: Jurnal Wacana Hukum Islam dan Kemanusiaan.

Although this problem has been gaining scholarly attention and raised in relation to various issues ranging from social injustice, rampant corruption, societal instability, wide social polarization and insurgent movements that affect the regional peace and stability at large, neither effective economic mechanism proposed nor implemented to address the problem effectively. In this regard, it is also important to appreciate the recent initiations in the field of Islamic economics to present an optional view to the existing and alien economic models in the Muslim world. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to fill up this research gap by proposing a model of mobilizing funds through the global cash-waqf institution. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts content analysis to construct this global cash waqf model for poverty alleviation in Muslim countries. Findings: The “global cash-waqf model” was proposed as an alternative that could be implemented and used to overcome the poverty matter in Muslim countries. It is assumed that the model will facilitate the fund mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return is going to assure full distribution and redistribution of wealth to eradicate the poverty in the Muslim world. The model was structured with a global vision in both the collection side and the distribution side. Originality/value: The model will facilitate the fund’s mobilization among Muslim countries, which in return achieves an Islamic goal of distribution and redistribution of wealth to assure the well-being of all humanities in the society. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

It maintains a largely religious orientation, as evidenced by the launch of Wakaf Ilmu for Islamic education in 2012. As a way of reinvigorating its developmental role to be in sync with the current needs of the Malay community in Singapore, this paper proposed the establishment of a waqf-based social micro venture fund (WSMVF) that promotes inclusive financial development for microentrepreneurs. This would help strengthen the community's economic status, amidst existing efforts on education, social and religious fronts. It reduces vulnerabilities of low-income families, strengthens their earning capability and promotes upward social mobility. This paper looked at charitable institutions which practice innovative and progressive forms of giving that the WSMVF could adopt. Resultantly, WSMVF is conceptualized based on the content analysis of cash waqf operations, profit and loss sharing modes and venture capital strategies. The organizational structure and operations of WSMVF bring new features into the present institution of waqf in Singapore, effectively expanding its role in the community.},

The intention behind applying CWLS model is to accelerate waqf as one of the Islamic social funds and particularly, to optimize the collection of cash waqf with Islamic securities to serve the public and at the same time to diversify the sovereign securities (Sukuk) in the Islamic financial market. Indeed, it is very crucial to assess the feasibility of the CWLS model as a new sovereign Sukuk instrument in the market despite its sharia compliant aspect. Especially, it needs to undergo a robust academic assessment such as formulation of the model, optimal level of each party such as the government, waqif, waqf management agencies (Nadzhir), etc . This is the objective and main motivation of the research. The paper will answer the following research questions: (i) What is the quantitative formula of SWI model especially SWI issuers and holders? What is the formula of the optimal impacts of SWI model, taking into account two types of waqif? Finally, what is the optimal formula for project financing, given the total cash waqf investment? Then, the paper technically constructs and develops the quantitative formulas of SWI instrument namely BWI, Ministry of Finance (MoF), waqf management agencies (Nadzhir), partners of Nadzhir and waqf investors (waqif). SWI formulation is derived based on SWI's terms and conditions, cash flow, intentions of waqf investors and tenor of SWI. Later, the optimal impacts of SWI are measured by formulating the present and future values of waqf investment to assess the Net Present Value (NPV) and limit theories to find variables determining the optimal SWI impacts on the public via project financing taking into account two types of waqif namely temporary waqif and permanent waqif. Finally, the paper contributes to the academic assessment of CWLS model (SWI instrument) particularly, it identifies variables determining the optimal implementation of CWLS model which might benefit the waqf stakeholders. © 2022 Hamdard Foundation Pakistan.

It will be managed and placed on the State Sukuk or SBSN instrument and the proceeds of its development are used to finance various economic, social and religious activities. Nonetheless, this CWLS model is perceived to be less than ideal by some parties. This study adopted a qualitative method using using library research approach. The data were collected through analysing literature papers, documentation and conducting an interview. Descriptive-analysis used to compare the statutory provisions, fatwas of MUI, and fiqh rules with the implementation of CWLS. The findings in this study indicate that CWLS is an appropriate with Indonesian context and Islamic principles. © 2021 Ascociacion Internacional de Economia Aplicada. All Rights Reserved.},

It aims to explore the factors that influence the behavioural intention of the managers in donating cash waqf (endowment) as part of their organisations’ corporate philanthropy. Design/methodology/approach: The theory of planned behaviour was used, and 701 questionnaires were emailed to PLCs’ managers. Four main variables, i.e. economic attitude, political pressure, perceived behavioural control (PBC) and personal moral obligation, were tested and analysed by using structural equation modelling. Findings: The findings showed that the first three variables, attitude, subjective norms and PBC of the management, significantly influenced management’s behavioural intention to donate cash waqf. Nonetheless, the personal moral obligation of the management was found to be insignificant. Research limitations/implications: One of the main limitations is that it involved only quantitative surveys with managers in Malaysia. In future, the findings of this study can be supported by interviews. Originality/value: The present study integrates the corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund of Shariah-compliant companies for the development of waqf property. The combination of CSR funds and waqf land will solve the waqf institution’s fund deficit issue. This will optimize waqf land development efficiency and benefit society. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Delphi and analytic network process methods, with three groups of relevant respondents, including experts (academic), BMT practitioners and regulators. Findings: The results show that the best cash waqf model for BMT is “BMT as Nazir (waqf manager) and also as cash waqf receiver Lembaga Keuangan Syariah Penerima Wakaf Uang (LKSPWU)”, followed by “BMT Association as representative Nazir of several certified BMTs”. Moreover, “long-term investment deposit” is the best to account cash waqf in the BMT balance sheet. With regard to financing, the most preferred one is “financing to regular Micro and Small Enterprises” of BMT members. Research limitations/implications: Having allowed BMT to be Nazir (waqf manager), this research might only benefit Indonesian policymakers, such as the Financial Services Authority and the Ministry of Cooperatives, BMTs and the National Waqf Board. But it may also benefit other countries which have similar characteristics. Practical implications: BMTs could adopt several alternatives of best models in managing cash waqf most appropriate for their specific conditions. Social implications: The management of cash waqf by BMT could help the social activities of the Baitul Maal through social cash waqf and, indirectly, by productive cash waqf. Originality/value: Studies have been limited, and to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is no specific study discussing the integrated cash waqf model, cash waqf account and cash waqf investment appropriate for BMT. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The study focuses on the institutional issue of money waqf law in Indonesia and its potential legal remedies. The type of field research and the approach are empirical and juridical. The results showed that the institutional problem of cash waqf law, namely the performance of Islamic Financial Institution Waqf Recipients and Indonesian Waqf Institutions, has not been optimal. In reality, the majority of people do not have money endowments in the Islamic Financial Institution Waqf Recipient, but instead have cash endowments with Nadzir. The reason is that the people are unfamiliar with Islamic Financial Institution-Cash Waqf Recipient and do not understand the existence of money endowments. Furthermore, the lack of coordination between the Islamic Financial Institution-Cash Waqf Recipient and the Indonesian Waqf Institution has made it challenging to control and evaluate the money endowments transferred from the Indonesian Waqf Institution to the Islamic Financial Institution-Cash Waqf Recipient. The legal solution involves optimizing the performance of both Indonesian Waqf Institutions and Islamic Financial Institution-Cash Waqf Recipients as money waqf legal institutions. This includes socializing the money waqf law in the community to increase trust and interest in public money endowments at the Islamic Financial Institution-Cash Waqf Recipient, thereby enabling the enforcement of money waqf law more effectively in Indonesia. © 2024 Science of Law.},

Sharia Banking, as a financial institution that carries out intermediation and social functions, has a strategic function in strengthening the assets of village-owned enterprises. Assets strengthening of village-owned enterprises, which can be carried out by Sharia banking through its intermediation and social functions, has become an interesting subject to research. This research combines normative legal research with analytical descriptive research parameters, especially research on secondary data in the form of primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials, by collecting systematic information regarding relevant facts and rules. Strengthening the assets of village-owned enterprises can be carried out through the intermediation function of Sharia Banking, namely through murabahah, mudharabah, and musyarakah financing. Meanwhile, through the social function of Sharia Banking, strengthening the assets of village-owned enterprises can be sourced from grant funds and other social funds or can come from cash waqf funds and utilized through managing the potential business activities of village-owned enterprises.

Most pesantrens are established on waqf land and are located in rural areas with great potential for implementing waqf-based livestock projects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a critical review on the models of waqf-based empowerment and financing for the livestock, agriculture or agribusiness sectors. Then, a proposed model was designed focused on livestock sector by using waqf land owned by pesantren. To strengthen the proposed model, the authors held a focus group discussion (FGD) by inviting regulators, academics, practitioners/consultants in animal husbandry, waqf, pesantren and economic empowerment. Findings: Pesantren as nazhir of waqf land can cooperate with baitul maal wat tamwil (BMT) acting as nazhir of cash waqf to form a breeders’ cooperative as the vehicle to carry out the process of producing and fattening cattle. The project is performed under a mudharaba, musharakah or ijara contract, which is supervised by pesantren and BMT. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on the Indonesian context due to it is influenced by country-specific conditions. Even so, some of the findings in this study can still be adopted by waqf asset managers in other Muslim countries, which also have potential in terms of the number of pesantren and waqf assets. Social implications: The proposed model can improve the quality of life of the poor in remote areas by fulfilling the demand for beef consumption accompanied by sustainable economic empowerment. Originality/value: This research focuses on solving the problem of meeting basic needs for beef by optimizing productive waqf in the livestock sector by involving the role of pesantren, which still needs to be discovered in the literature on the use of waqf land. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

This model is designed to align with Shariah principles, ensuring sustainability and enduring impact. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a qualitative methodology, where a focus group discussion was conducted with six stakeholders. The participants consisted of takaful operators, legal experts and other industry players. The participants were presented with the proposed cash waqf takaful model and their feedback was recorded. Legal issues related to linking waqf with takaful were also identified and discussed. Findings: The study highlights the need for innovative financial solutions to support Malaysia's aging population. It proposes a cash waqf takaful model, leveraging crowd funding for sustainability. Legal hurdles and recommendations for overcoming them are discussed, along with suggestions for future research on quantitative validation and regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the holistic approach of the proposed model in addressing the well-being of Malaysia's senior citizens. Practical implications: The proposed takaful model presents opportunities for takaful operators to integrate Islamic social finance into their operations, enabling easier access to takaful for the elderly community. By eliminating financial barriers, it can transform the takaful landscape, ensuring inclusivity and financial security for aging populations. Moreover, policymakers see it as a blueprint for sustainable financial solutions and social welfare enhancement globally. Originality/value: The study introduces a novel cash waqf takaful model to support Malaysia's aging population, leveraging crowdfunding for sustainability. It addresses legal challenges unique to Malaysia and proposes collaboration with State Islamic Religious Authorities.

Additionally, it draws upon interviews with experts in Waqf and Islamic banking and finance to grasp the potential and viability of establishing a Waqf from provisioned funds in the UAE. Findings: Establishing a Waqf using provisioned funds is permissible. Although Waqf is always advantageous, in the current situation, endowing Islamic financial institutions' provisioned funds will not adequately address societal needs in the UAE. This is because the majority of annual returns on UAE Waqf investments are low compared to the amount invested, and there is an urgency to disburse these funds to those in need. If these needs are identified and met using Zakat and other charitable funds, a Waqf can be created from provisioned funds and prove beneficial. However, the authors have suggested some proposals to establish a relevant Waqf from provisioned funds that satisfy the required conditions and address the societal needs of the UAE. They concluded that creating a Waqf school would be the best suggestion. Research limitations/implications: The scope of this study is limited to examining the use of IFIs' provisioned funds to establish a Waqf in the UAE. Furthermore, the findings and conclusions of this study may be applicable only to the UAE and may not be universally applicable to other countries. Practical implications: Proposed initiatives to create a “Cash Waqf” fund and a “Waqf School” using provisioned funds are anticipated to bring about immediate positive changes for the underprivileged and the wider UAE community. Furthermore, the sustainable establishment of any Waqf could greatly benefit society by addressing all societal needs through Zakat and charitable contributions. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to explore the potential and practicality of creating a Waqf using provisioned funds from IFIs in the UAE. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the management of cash waqf fund generation through the implementation of istibdal in Kedah. Design/methodology/approach: The data are obtained through literature and empirical data. The authors first review the literature on the importance of waqf fundraising, the implementation factors of istibdal waqf and the relevance of istibdal method as a waqf fund generation medium to understand the extent to which the scholarly articles have discussed these topics. Furthermore, the authors conducted face-to-face interviews with two Kedah Islamic Religious Council (Majlis Agama Islam Kedah [MAIK]) officers, who were directly involved in the affairs of istibdal waqf to obtain holistic information regarding implementing istibdal waqf properties in Kedah. As a result, several themes are defined from the interview data before being analysed based on the content analysis method. Findings: The results of the study show two istibdal implementation processes outlined by the Kedah Islamic Religious Council (MAIK), namely, the istibdal implementation process for waqf land registered title deed, and waqf land registered as reserve certificate for religious use like mosque and cemetery. The results also showed three factors in implementing istibdal in Kedah: the acquisition of waqf land by the state authority (PBN), istibdal application by the state education department (JPN) and istibdal application by the mosque committee. Out of eight cases of istibdal implementation, four have generated cash funds for MAIK through investment methods from the sale of waqf lands and rental of replaced shophouses that are able to cover the expenses of managing waqf properties in Kedah. Several suggestions are also recommended for MAIK to improve its istibdal policy, thus enabling the institution to generate cash waqf funds at the maximum rate. Research limitations/implications: This study only focused on the implementation factors and the generation of cash waqf funds through istibdal in Kedah, while it can be expanded to other states like Terengganu, Kelantan and Penang. Furthermore, this study only interviewed officers who manage matters related to the affairs of waqf properties, as the session can actually be extended to other respondents, such as those specialising in cash fund generation investments and others. Practical implications: This study proposed some improvements to the policy and guidelines of istibdal waqf property to MAIK after a few shortcomings were identified throughout this study. If improved, these proposals will have a significant impact, especially on the waqf properties involved in the implementation of istibdal, where it has the potential to bring cash generation and ensure the constant economic value of waqf properties. Social implications: This study has a tremendous impact on society, in which their areas have cash waqf funds that can be developed. It can benefit the needy and increase funds for the welfare expenditure of Muslims through rental income, investment and development. Progress on waqf property provides a high indication of the efficiency of an organisation in managing the waqf property. Thus, the public, especially the rich, is motivated to fulfil their charitable practices through waqf mechanism and share their wealth with the needy. Originality/value: This study contributes to comprehensive field data on the implementation factors and generation of cash waqf funds through the implementation of istibdal in Kedah. The results of this study are significant to be used by waqf property management. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the factors influencing the intention of Muslim Millennial Generation in Indonesia to donate cash waqf digitally. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was employed, surveying 284 Muslim Millennial Generation in Indonesia. The study integrated the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate the key factors driving the intention to contribute to cash waqf digitally. The researcher analyzed data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The findings of this study indicate that all hypotheses related to the variables are supported, including both direct and indirect correlations, except for perceived religiosity. This study confirms that the decision of millennials to donate cash waqf online is influenced by various factors, including their attitudes, the environment they are in, their ability to control their behavior, their perception of the ease and usefulness of technology and the availability of suitable facilities. Knowledge of technology is also a decisive component. Nevertheless, this study yielded intriguing findings that the perceived level of religious devotion does not impact the millennials’ willingness to make online cash waqf donations. Practical implications: This study’s findings offer valuable insights for waqf institutions, providing a better understanding of Muslim millennials’ characteristics and preferences regarding spending, donations and waqf activities. This understanding can be instrumental in enhancing innovative digital platforms for cash waqf in the digital economy era. Originality/value: This study uniquely explores the determinants of digital cash waqf donations among Muslim Millennial Generation in Indonesia. Contributions include integrating the DTPB and the TAM for a comprehensive analysis. Cross-disciplinary perspectives from behavioral economics and digital marketing enrich the research. Comparative studies and potential longitudinal analysis enhance depth, providing nuanced insights into the dynamic factors shaping digital donation behavior among Muslim millennials. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The findings suggest that there was a downward trend in the capital levels of cash waqfs, despite an increase in numbers of such foundations, from the sixteenth century to the early twentieth century. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that the capital levels of cash waqfs established by men exhibited a similar trend, whereas the pattern of capital levels for women was an approximately inverted U-shape during the same period.

	abstract = {Cash waqf is a form of contemporary waqf that has great potential in the modern world. In Indonesia, despite its potential of 180 trillion per year, cash waqf collection, management, and distribution are not optimal. Nonetheless, the infrastructure sector in Indonesia faces obstacles, particularly in terms of funding. The innovation of the CWLFRA (Cash Waqf Linked DINFRA) model is, therefore, a solution to these two issues, as the proposed model is the result of an integration between efforts to optimize cash waqf and infrastructure financing via the Infrastructure Investment Fund (DINFRA). In this CWLFRA innovation, waqf funds will be allocated to the mauquf 'alaih from the profits of infrastructure investment funds, which will become a source of long-term usable assets. As a result, the purpose of this academic paper is to develop a model capable of bolstering the ecosystem of Islamic social financial institutions and maximizing the potential achievement of cash waqf in Indonesia as a means of implementing sustainable finance and an effective instrument in reviving national economy through infrastructure development. In addition, this study seeks to determine the viability of the potential for developing the productivity of cash waqf in an effort to increase the effectiveness of achieving cash waqf to support economic sustainability with infrastructure potential. Nine respondents representing academicians and expert practitioners from both the waqf and infrastructure sectors filled out questionnaires to collect data. According to the results of the Delphi test, all respondents believed that there was a relationship between the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) indicators, indicating that this model is implementable. Moreover, based on the level of agreement of respondents, this model has the potential to contribute positively to national economic recovery, become a sustainable source of social funds, optimize the potential of waqf in Indonesia, strengthen the ecosystem of waqf social finance institutions, and improve the quality of management and maintenance of Indonesia's infrastructure. These findings demonstrate that integrating financial waqf with existing public infrastructure could positively affect the sustainability of national economic development. The novel aspect of this paper is the proposed cash waqf management system, which can serve as a useful reference for policymakers and waqf institutions seeking to develop a more effective waqf concept in terms of collection, administration, and distribution. Consequently, this study aims to demonstrate the potential for cash waqf, which can be integrated with DINFRA's product through the innovation of the CWL-FRA model, to become an investment instrument and offer a diversity of options to the waqf community. © The Author(s) (2023).},

Design/methodology/approach: The present study used self-determination theory and 423 respondents, of which 205 respondents are from Malaysia and 218 from Indonesia. The study developed a self-administrative questionnaire, and it is distributed through an online survey method, and the data are analysed using SmartPLS partial least squares analysis. Findings: The results show that perceived donor effectiveness and moral obligation factors influence both Malaysians and Indonesian millennials to make cash waqf contributions. Meanwhile, the face concern factor did not significantly affect millennials in Malaysia and Indonesia to contribute cash waqf. Furthermore, the sense of self-worth factor appears to significantly influence only Indonesian millennials but not Malaysian millennials. Research limitations/implications: The research findings have significant theoretical and practical ramifications. Firstly, while face concern has a positive effect on millennials’ willingness to contribute cash to waqf, it is not statistically significant in Muslim populations. This implies that to persuade millennials to make cash waqf contributions, the face concern argument should be avoided. Originality/value: The comparative study between Malaysia and Indonesia adds new value to this study. These two Muslim majority countries have similar attributes in terms of religion, demography and race background. Furthermore, the focus of this study, which targets units of analysis from millennials, has received very little attention in the literature related to cash waqf. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose — This research examines cash waqf-linked ṣukūk (CWLS) and ascertains its viability in Malaysia under the relevant legal and regulatory frameworks of waqf (Islamic endowment) and ṣukūk (Islamic investment securities). This is explored with a view to a possible implementation of CWLS in Malaysia by Islamic social and commercial finance institutions. Design/Methodology/Approach — The research adopts a qualitative methodology and uses content analysis in synthesising relevant data to determine the viability and prospects of CWLS in Malaysia. Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted, and data obtained therefrom was analysed alongside published literature on CWLS to identify issues in the applicable waqf and ṣukūk legal and regulatory frameworks that pertain to CWLS viability. Findings — The combination of cash waqf with ṣukūk is potentially an impactful financing mechanism for mobilising funds whereby charity is linked with productive and income-generating economic activities. CWLS facilitates the development of alternative social financing instruments that expedite social welfare and economic revival in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Indonesia demonstrates. However, Malaysia’s waqf legal and regulatory framework have established a decentralised system of waqf administration, which may impede the efficacy of the structure and operations of CWLS in the country. Hence the research proposes a reform of the framework to enable the establishment of a more capable and viable CWLS structure for digital, retail and institutional investors. Originality/Value — This research discovers hindrances to the prospect of CWLS in the legal, Sharīʿah and regulatory dynamics of waqf and ṣukūk in Malaysia that previous studies overlooked. This research provides an in-depth understanding of challenges to CWLS’ implementation in Malaysia with invaluable insight for regulators, policymakers, practitioners and researchers, thereby contributing to practical knowledge in the area. © Sherin Kunhibava, Aishath Muneeza, Zakariya Mustapha, Maryam Khalid and Thong Ming Sen.},

	abstract = {Purpose — Agriculture is regarded as one of the most effective areas for alleviating poverty in the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) nations. This study’s primary purpose is to present a novel integrated social and commercial financing model known as salam and muzāraʿah crowdfunding waqf (SMCW) model as a fundraising tool or as an alternative funding source for waqf organisations and agriculturalists. Design/Methodology/Approach — This qualitative research analysed the relevant literature on crowdfunding, cash waqf and agriculture, and the Islamic contracts of salam (forward sale) and muzāraʿah (sharecropping). Findings — With the synchronisation of all stakeholders in the agricultural sector, this study is projected to address the issue of inadequate land and funding and to foster innovation and inclusivity in Islamic financial products. The study suggests a practical funding alternative model for farmers that uses waqf institutions, crowdfunding and Islamic banks to alleviate poverty in OIC countries. Originality/Value — The proposed model takes a novel approach to developing a new financing option for farmers by fusing traditional Islamic finance principles with contemporary crowdfunding platforms. It provides an ethical and sustainable financing option based on Islamic values and addresses the issues faced by small farmers in the OIC.Research Limitations/Implications — The proposed research has significant implications for stakeholders in the agricultural sector, the Islamic finance industry, crowdfunding platforms, and Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority countries. It offers a new financing option based on ethical and sustainable principles that can support the expansion and development of the agricultural sector. Thus, this study enriches the literature on waqf, crowdfunding and Islamic financing. Future researchers may examine a model integrating waqf, crowdfunding and Islamic contracts that target other sectors. Practical Implications — The study’s practical benefits stem from its potential to address the problems of inadequate land and funding while fostering innovation and inclusivity in Islamic financial products, ultimately assisting in the reduction of poverty in the agricultural sector in OIC countries.

	abstract = {Purpose: The potential of waqf is so great in Indonesia but has not been optimized. This paper aims to offer a model for waqf institutions to adopt financial technology for developing productive and social waqf. The authors cunduct an assesment of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) in seeing to the crowdfunders’ behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a structural equation using the partial least square approach to test the hypotheses. Based on purposive sampling, the spread of questionnaires through online surveys throughout Indonesia consists of all islands. A total of 297 respondents collected the questionnaires. Findings: Based on the findings, acceptance models have a positive and significant impact on the behavioral intentions of crowdfunders, while Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology have no significant effect. Research limitations/implications: The sample of this study involved potential crowdfunders from all over the islands in Indonesia, but these results cannot be generalized because of limitations in terms of the sampling technique used. However, the results of this study can be used as an illustration of how crowdfunders behave in donating money using financial technology. Practical implications: The results of this study provide a comprehensive perspective for policymakers, especially the Indonesian Waqf Board as the waqf authority that regulates waqf nazir to improve quality by adopting crowdfunding financial technology in collecting waqf funds. In addition, in terms of implications for the government, this waqf crowdfunding model will reduce spending and increase economic growth. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first in looking at the waqf crowdfunding in Indonesia by looking at two reliable technology determinant models. Studies on cash waqf in Indonesia are many, but they do not look at the issue of crowdfunding, which has gained more attention recently. This paper aims to fill this gap, and this becomes the novelty. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Using questionnaires administered to the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the empowerment programs in Central Lampung, South Tangerang, Trenggalek East Java, and Bima Nusa Tenggara Indonesia, the study constructs three impact indicators: the welfare index, financial inclusion index, and social and spiritual index. The data are analyzed using the difference-in-difference (DiD) method, where the three impact indices are compared between the two groups of respondents in 2021 and 2022. We find that the CWLS empowerment programs improve the welfare and financial inclusion of beneficiaries but have no discernible effect on social and spiritual participation. However, the DID analysis reveals that the overall impacts of welfare, financial inclusion, and social and spiritual participation are not statistically different between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries in 2021 and 2022. This study provides significant implications for policymakers and nadzir to enhance the impacts of CWLS on socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. © 2024 Bank Indonesia Institute.

	abstract = {Purpose — This research explores the dimensions of perceived iḥsān (altruism) and trust, utilising a framework rooted in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), to comprehensively explore the intricate motivations and ethical considerations underlying individuals’ engagement with digital waqf platforms. Design/Methodology/Approach — Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was applied to analyse primary data collected from 202 Muslims residing in four cities in Indonesia. Findings — The investigation unveiled that performance expectancy, social influence and perceived iḥsān significantly impact the intention of digital waqf usage. On the other hand, trust affects a person’s intention, shaping their behaviour to donate through digital waqf platforms. In contrast, effort expectancy does not affect the intention to engage in waqf through digital channels, and facilitating condition do not affect user behaviour. Originality/Value — This study introduces a novel approach by incorporating perceived iḥsān and trust dimensions into the UTAUT model to achieve the objective of this research. In particular, it offers unique insights into the disbursement of cash waqf among Muslims via digital platforms (e.g., online channels). Practical Implications — The study emphasises that individuals from the low middle-class demonstrate empathy and mutual support in the face of financial limitations. The article offers valuable recommendations to the government, aligning with Indonesia’s Golden 2045 goal. These recommendations encompass the implementation of advanced digitisation in waqf management, integration of waqf data into robust financial management systems, and intensified educational campaigns aimed at raising public awareness on cash waqf, particularly among the younger generation. © Dahlia Bonang, Shafinar Ismail and Raditya Sukmana.},

In doing so, this study integrates knowledge of cash waqf and trust variables within the theory of planned behavior (TPB), allowing an examination of the mediating role of TPB variables and trust within the relationship between knowledge of cash waqf and intention for online cash waqf behavior. Design/methodology/approach: To carry out an empirical analysis, the authors developed a well-structured questionnaire and distributed it to a group of students currently enrolled in PTKIN, obtaining 443 usable responses. The partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was used for the dual purposes of data analysis and hypothesis testing. Findings: This study demonstrates that factors such as attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, trust and knowledge of cash waqf have a significant and favorable influence on the intention to donate through e-cash waqf. Knowledge of cash waqf impacts attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and trust. The final analysis shows that attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and trust partially mediate the relationship between knowledge and intention in the online cash waqf context. Practical implications: The aforementioned elucidates the paramount importance of trust in shaping individuals’ tendencies to engage in cash waqfs. The insights mentioned have the potential to be used by cash waqf establishments to promote transparency and accountability, ultimately bolstering the confidence of potential donors. Originality/value: The concepts of waqf and the use of online cash waqf as a means of donation in developing countries are relatively new. In this study, the intention of students to adopt online cash waqf was predicted for the first time by considering their knowledge of cash waqf and their trust in online cash waqf transactions. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Cash waqf is a powerful financial instrument that deals with the issue of liquidity constraints in waqf institutions. While there are several models of cash waqf operating in different countries, there is increasing demand for innovative cash waqf models, especially within the financial technology context. This paper aims to propose a practical alternative model of funding for waqf institutions using the concepts of crowdfunding and cash waqf. Design/methodology/approach: This study evaluated the literature relevant to cash waqf models that have been implemented in different countries and proposed a new viable alternative model. Findings: Results offer an alternative financing model, named crowdfunding cash waqf model, for waqf institutions to overcome monetary constraints and enable development projects to be completed. Practical implications: The current study has important implications for both officials and relevant stakeholders. It is sought to bring better consistency between cash waqf donors, solving the liquidity problem faced by waqf institutions, enhancing the transparency of waqf institutions and their use of waqf funds, wealth circulation and financing businesses without interest-based loans (riba). By incorporating a crowdfunding and investment mechanism in the model, this method of collecting funds will assist governments in reducing their expenditure on waqf institutions and other social development programmes. Originality/value: The proposed model differs from current methods of generating cash waqf, including those are also internet-based. The proposed model is devised to help waqf institutions achieve financial sustainability by including an investment mechanism in the model to sustain the development of waqf projects. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, the under-collection issue has been characterizing the cash waqf movement globally. This study aims to examine how understanding the distinct cash waqf donating behavior across different generations has the potential to address the problem. Design/methodology/approach: This study extends the theory of planned behavior by adding religiosity and knowledge variables into the standard model, using the partial least square structural equation modeling. A survey is conducted on 684 respondents representing the main provinces in Indonesia and four major generations (Baby Boomers [BB], Generations X, Y and Z). Findings: Religiosity, Knowledge, Attitude, Subjective Norms and Perceived Behavioral Control directly or indirectly affect cash waqf intention. The effect is contingent on the characteristics of generations. Research limitations/implications: This study covers only the Indonesian case with limited coverage of the more heterogeneous provinces in the country. The sample distribution for BB can also be enlarged. Practical implications: Cash waqf institutions (government and private) should apply the dynamic segmenting strategy, where the diversification of the promotion, marketing, awareness and approaches are contingent on the different characteristics of each generation.

Otherwise, a subsidiary of the State Islamic Religious Council may act as a takaful operator providing waqf-based takaful services. Above all, the takaful operator is required to establish a Sharīah-compliant mechanism for managing the fund while strictly avoiding the risk of losing the capital of the waqf fund and providing the takaful services as needed by the participants. Nevertheless, some constraints and challenges for the implementation of the waqf model in Malaysia may remain, and such constraints should be addressed by all parties involved in order to make this takaful model a reality in Malaysia.

The findings revealed that the proposed cash waqf model leveraged communal wealth for long-term developmental projects, ensuring sustainability and adherence to Islamic jurisprudence. The study concludes with the establishment of a specialized waqf institution to manage these funds, advocating for transparency and accountability to foster trust and a culture of philanthropy. The proposed model not only holds significant potential for transforming the economic landscape of Indonesia’s new capital but also offers a blueprint for integrating Islamic philanthropic principles with modern financial strategies, setting a precedent for similar initiatives globally.

	abstract = {Purpose: Exploring the current phenomenon of the cash waqf-linked sukuk (CWLS) program issuance that involves Islamic banks in Indonesia, this paper aims to investigate the key barriers and intentional behaviors in realizing wealthy Muslims’ contribution to the program using the intermediary function of Islamic banks. Moreover, this study provides a conceptual framework to set effective marketing strategies to encourage wealthy Muslims to become cash waqf founders and sustain their contribution. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study used a literature review and in-depth interviews to generate insights for developing a model of wealthy Muslims’ behavior toward cash waqf programs held by Islamic banks. Findings: The study identified low trust, literacy and transparency as the biggest barriers to cash waqf contributions, but suggests that a greater role for Islamic banks, personal engagement and innovative product offerings can help to overcome these barriers. The study also identified three new behavioral dimensions that are important for understanding wealthy Muslims’ contributions to cash waqf: personal financial planning, accountability and political issues. Based on these findings, the study proposes 10 strategies for all stakeholders to pursue in the short and medium term to promote cash waqf contributions from wealthy Muslims. Research limitations/implications: This study only involved respondents from three major cities in Indonesia: Jakarta, Bandung and Surabaya because these cities have a large number of wealthy Muslims. Future research can collect more samples from all major cities in Indonesia or other Muslim majority countries, and use other qualitative methodology such as phenomenological, ethnographic, grounded theory, case study or action research. The findings of this study can be the starting point for further research and the proposed conceptual framework requires empirical testing in the future. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be a basis for policymakers and the Islamic financial industry in formulating marketing, education and socialization strategies for innovative cash waqf programs. Social implications: The findings of this study will support the acceleration of cash waqf collection for cash waqf initiatives through Islamic banks. Moreover, with a better understanding of the factors impeding and motivating the most potential Muslim groups to contribute to the innovative cash waqf program, the ultimate goal of higher national socio-economic development becomes more attainable. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to investigate wealthy Muslims’ behavioral factors for contributing to innovative cash waqf held by Islamic banks, from various stakeholder perspectives. It fills a research gap in the literature on innovative cash waqf and behavior. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose — Muslim communities in Thailand have lately used cash waqf as a creative strategy to raise seed money from Muslim contributors to implement religious projects such as building religious institutions like mosques and Islamic schools. The factors influencing this unique kind of giving have, to date, rarely been studied. This research attempts to examine the motivational and economic elements that impact people’s willingness to donate (WTD) cash waqf to such religious projects. Design/Methodology/Approach — The study utilised a Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) and an ordinal logistic regression method to examine the effects of various independent variables on the WTD. A validated structured questionnaire was utilised to collect primary data from 404 cash waqf donors in the southernmost provinces of Thailand. Findings — When comparing donors with medium income levels to those with higher salary levels, the findings show that donors in the higher salary category were more likely to generate a higher WTD propensity. The probability of donors’ WTD was positively influenced by any reductions in debt levels. Furthermore, factors such as belief in the afterlife, the salience of one’s Muslim identity, and the experience of a warm glow were found to have a positive impact on individuals’ WTD cash waqf to religious projects. Originality/Value — This study utilised the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to examine the cash waqf practices, which has received limited attention in previous scholarly works. Furthermore, the variables employed in this research serve to broaden the scope of understanding in the realm of Islamic philanthropy, surpassing the confines of the attitude-intention framework. Research Limitations/Implications — The factors used in this study encompass the internal drives of potential donors. In reality, a number of external circumstances, such as the validity of the waqf project and the donor’s accessibility to other options, may have an impact on the donor’s choice. Additionally, the scope of this study was restricted to the southern border provinces of Thailand. It would be of interest to conduct additional research that broadens the sample size and geographical scope to include other regions within the country or even other countries with diverse cultural and socioeconomic contexts. This would enable the generalisation of the findings obtained from this study. Practical Implications — Waqf fundraising organisations should focus on boosting awareness among high-income, low-debt people. This population group donates more than middle-and lower-class people. Mosques and religious organisations can use a strategy to help donors reassess the spiritual benefits of waqf giving in relation to the afterlife, the reinforcement of their Muslim identity, and the emotional satisfaction of giving. These motivators will increase the likelihood of mosque donations. © Aris Hassama and Nor Azmat Ismail.},

This study is a quantitative research that focuses on the millennial generation in the Sumatran Island. The sample size for this study consists of 349 respondents. The data analysis approach employed is the Partial Least Squares (PLS) Test utilizing smart PLS software version 7.0. The findings indicate that Perceived Usefulness (PU) does not exert a substantial impact on the decision to waqf money. This implies that the level of benefits experienced by users of the digital sharia banking system does not have the ability to affect the decision to donate money through waqf. The perceived ease of use (PEU) positively and significantly influences the decision to waqf money. This implies that the higher the comfort felt by the millennial generation through the digital sharia banking system, the more likely they are to decide to waqf money. The sense of the surrounding environment, known as Subjective Norm (SN), has a positive and considerable influence on the decision to waqf money through the digital sharia system. Hubristic Pride (HP) does not exert a substantial influence on the inclination to donate money through the digital sharia system, indicating that the decision of the millennial generation to engage in this practice is not driven by hubris pride in the form of narcissism. © 2024, State Islamic University of Ar-Raniry Faculty of Sharia and Law.

	abstract = {The monitoring of upstream and downstream halal standards is crucial for Indonesia due to its large Muslim population and the increasing global demand for halal products. Indonesia has the potential to become a leading center for the Sharia economy and finance. Thus, developing the halal food and Islamic finance sectors is one strategy to unlock their potential, while strengthening the halal-value chain ecosystem further aids the expansion of the halal food industry. Therefore, this study aims to develop the halal food sector and the Islamic financial sector by integrating the halal value chain into the establishment of a food court financed through the Cash Waqf Linked Sukuk (CWLS) Islamic financial instrument. This study used qualitative methods with primary and secondary data sources. The primary data came from observations and interviews with the Indonesian Waqf Board (BWI). While the secondary data used in this study includes research findings regarding the Halal Value Chain as well as the framework for the application of CWLS funds. The result shows that accelerating the establishment of a halal food court ecosystem can be implemented through CWLS funding. This framework offers financial assistance while maintaining the halal status of food court management. This study provides suggestions to the government on how to enhance the halal ecosystem for Indonesia’s halal ecosystem improvement. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Most People’s Religious Schools (Sekolah Agama Rakyat-SAR) face financial constraints in managing and administering schools. Therefore, SAR administrators strive to obtain funds through instruments such as waqf, for example, cash waqf. However, until now, the implementation of cash waqf instruments in SAR has not received much attention among SAR administrators. Nevertheless, Sekolah Rendah Islam Tahfiz Integrasi Al-Fateh, Raub, Pahang (SRITI, Al-Fateh) is one of the SARs that has implemented cash waqf and has had a positive impact on the school’s development. The objective of this study is to identify the method of implementing cash waqf and to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation in sustaining the finances of Al-Fateh Integrated Tahfiz Islamic Primary School (SRITI), Raub, Pahang, Malaysia. This is a qualitative study. A face-to-face interview was carried out as a data collection method using semi-structured questions involving three respondents comprising the chairperson, a local officer, and a project manager of SRITI Al-Fateh. The study data was supported by secondary sources such as books, magazines, journals, articles, and others. The data obtained was analyzed using the content analysis method. The study outcome finds that SRITI Al-Fateh has collected waqf in the form of cash. The funds collected came from various groups of the society such as individuals and NGOs. From the funds, a two-story school building was successfully constructed, and a mosque (still being constructed), and they serve as an activity center for teachers and students. This study hopes that the method of implementation of cash waqf by SRITI Al-Fateh can serve as guidance for SAR in Malaysia and other educational institutions in the effort to sustain the school finances. Future work can be done by making comparisons with one or more other SARs to show the effectiveness of cash waqf implementation. © (2024), (Universiti Sultan Azlan Shah). All rights reserved.},

Design/Methodology/Approach — This research uses partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed model based on a sample of 80 Islamic economics students at public and private universities in Bandung Indonesia. Findings — The findings show that, first, the intention of students to give cash waqf for charitable and/or social purposes is affected by the level of education and the level of religiosity, whereas the variable ‘access to social media information’ is not found to be significant. Second, the literacy level about cash waqf among students is influenced by the level of education and access to media information, while the level of religiosity is not significant. Third, the level of cash waqf literacy does not mediate the influence of education level, the level of access to media information, and the level of religiosity on the intention to give cash waqf.Originality/Value — The mediating role of literacy adds originality and value in discovering students’ willingness to participate in cash waqf, a form of Islamic charity involving cash donations. By identifying the barriers and motivation for participation, the study provides practical suggestions for educational institutions to implement educational programmes, allocate financing, and develop awareness campaigns to promote a culture of giving and social responsibility among students. Research Limitations/Implications — The findings in this study are limited only to the region of Bandung; therefore, conducting research in different contexts could provide further insights. Practical Implications — This study highlights the important role of the level of education in increasing the level of literacy and the intention to donate cash waqf among students. The implication is that universities are invited to offer innovative patterns of waqf education and training. By providing a clear understanding of cash waqf awareness among college students, this research can assist in designing appropriate literacy and educational campaigns. © 2024, International Shari’ah Research Academy for Islamic Finance (ISRA).

This research paper aims to explore the role of waqf as an instrument for a sustainable growth system and to suggest a model for socioeconomic development in an economy like that of Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative research is based on analytical methods to arrive at the frameworks and a model that could facilitate the revival of waqf for community development/social inclusion in economies like that of Pakistan. Findings: As most of the OIC member states like Pakistan are facing serious financial problems due to debt servicing obligations, promoting Waqf for various socioeconomic and cultural functions is a vital requirement for such economies. The inability of the state institutions in providing necessary civic, health and education facilities to the public is causing serious harm to the balance of the society. It requires promoting a formal system of charity and using FinTech for waqf-based donations and financing the micro businesses. The perpetuity complimented by the profitability of the waqf properties makes the waqf institutions sustainable and effective when compared to individual charities. Research limitations/implications: This is conceptual research discussing the potential of waqf in light of its historical role. Researchers may undertake empirical studies on awqaf operations in various jurisdictions and their role in the empowerment of the poor. Practical implications: The research will provide the researchers with insight into the potential of waqf as a tool for community development. Besides, it will enable policymakers and implementation authorities to socialize charity for sustained benefits and welfare. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first major research that discusses the role of waqf in economies facing budgetary and trade deficits in the eradication of poverty and the promotion of social and economic entrepreneurship in realizing the community development targets for the economies like that of Pakistan. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The popularity of financial technology (fintech) is rising in society due to fintech's direct benefits to users. This digital-based approach is one of the outputs of the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which transformed the path of human history and resulted in the development of digital transformation strategy innovation, more commonly referred to as digitalisation. Previous literature has predicted that integrating fintech into waqf management will facilitate fintech's growth and expand waqf outreach in Malaysia. Therefore, this paper aims to examine the impact of “Industry 4.0” on the expansion of fintech into cash waqf in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses Rogers' (2003) diffusion of innovation (DOI) model. In addition, a quantitative approach based on structural equation modelling (SEM) was utilised to analyse the relationship between awareness, knowledge, relative advantage, social norms, perceived trust and fintech adoption in waqf institutions by using the tool Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) version 23.0 with maximum likelihood estimation. Findings: The overall indicate that perceived trust and social norms significantly influence the adoption of fintech by Malaysian waqf. At the same time, other factors such as awareness, relative advantage and knowledge do not appear to significantly influence the adoption of fintech amongst Malaysian waqf institutions. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes significantly to the current literature concerning the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the wave of technologies. In addition, this study supports relevant theories, including DOI and other technology adoption theories. Aside from this, the study provides empirical contributions to waqf management regarding collecting and distributing waqf, improving the level of regulation of the waqf institutions and enhancing trust between donors, waqf management and beneficiaries. This study is amongst the first in the area of waqf that focus on Malaysian waqf intitutions. Originality/value: This is important for policy development to support the utilisation of fintech for waqf institutions, which leads to more transparency and efficiency.

	abstract = {Purpose — This study employs a substantial number of primary sources of cash waqf contracts (waqfiyyas) to conduct a long-term analysis of cash waqf institutions (henceforth abbreviated as cash waqfs) and the real wages of waqf employees in Ottoman Rumelia from the sixteenth century to World War I. Design/Methodology/Approach — The descriptive analysis includes economic variables recorded in contracts. The analysis focuses on the trend of capital levels, profit shares (ribḥ), and numbers of cash waqfs that prevailed over the 50-year sub-period used in the analysis, and the daily wages of five different groups, including imams, muezzins, scholars, trustees and daily workers. Findings — The findings of this study indicate that, despite experiencing a decline in capital and income, cash waqfs in Rumelia paid employees wages close to market wages. It has been observed that although the real purchasing power of employees and their living standards have increased when measured in current Turkish lira and US dollar values, this improvement did not occur during the early twentieth century. Originality/Value — This study conducts a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the long-term changes in the capital levels and real wages of Rumelia’s cash waqfs, providing a valuable contribution to the field of study. Research Limitations/Implications — The results reveal that the wages of individuals employed in cash waqfs increased from the sixteenth to the late nineteenth century, which may suggest economic growth and rising living standards. These wages were close to market wages paid in Istanbul. During the early twentieth century, real wages decreased, potentially due to a decline in capital levels and external shocks resulting from wars, uprisings and revolutionary movements in Rumelia. Further research that expands the sample size and geographical scope to encompass other regions within the empire would be beneficial. Such an expansion would facilitate the generalisation of the findings obtained in this study. Practical Implications — To guarantee the long-term success and achievement of objectives of contemporary financial institutions that draw inspiration from this historical experience, it is crucial to maintain an efficient balance between wages and income from capital. © Bora Altay and Mehmet Bulut.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the factors of implementing istibdal waqf and generating cash waqf funds through istibdal in Penang. This study was based on the previous problem statements, stating that waqf property could not be developed due to lack of cash funds. This has allowed the study to explore the factors for implementing istibdal waqf property and the extent to which the istibdal method can generate cash waqf funds in Penang. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted a qualitative method by conducting semi-structured interviews to achieve its research goals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to comprehensively understand the current practice on istibdal cases in Penang State Islamic Religious Council (MAINPP) through official institutions concerned with waqf management practices in Penang. This research relied on purposive sampling to select the informants. It is a sampling strategy to select the informants in advance based on the research question. To achieve the purpose of this study, two officers from MAINPP were selected based on their working experience and specialisation criteria. As a result, several themes were successfully defined from the interview data before being analysed based on the content analysis method. Findings: The results present three istibdal implementation processes outlined by MAINPP, namely, the istibdal implementation process for waqf land involved in the acquisition by state authorities (PBN), non-productive waqf land and istibdal applications from certain parties. The results also reveal two factors in implementing istibdal in Penang: the acquisition of waqf land by PBN and the application of istibdal for cemeteries by the Islamic Centre of Universiti Sains Malaysia. From the point of cash fund generation, no case of istibdal implementation records the generation of cash funds to MAINPP. Thus, this study ends with proposals for improving the process and implementing istibdal in Penang to generate cash funds to help MAINPP manage waqf properties. Research limitations/implications: The study only focused on implementing factors and generating cash waqf funds through istibdal in Penang. At the same time, it can be expanded to other states like Terengganu, Johor and Kelantan. This study only interviewed officers who manage matters related to the affairs of waqf properties. Therefore, it is believed that the study can be extended to other respondents, such as experts in cash fund generation investments and others. Practical implications: This study proposed improvements to the policy and practice of istibdal waqf property to MAINPP after the shortcomings were identified throughout this study. If improved, these proposals will significantly impact the waqf properties involved in implementing istibdal, where it can generate cash and ensure the constant economic value of waqf properties. Social implications: This study has great implications for society through the development of a cash waqf fund that can provide great benefits to the needy, in addition to increasing funds for the welfare expenditure of Muslims through rental income, investment and development. Progress and significant impact on waqf property can provide a high indicator of the efficiency of an organisation in managing waqf property. This can attract the interest of the public, especially the wealthy, to always fulfil welfare through the waqf mechanism and share the wealth with the needy. Originality/value: This study contributes to comprehensive field data on the implementation of istibdal in Penang. The data analysis results are significant to be used by the waqf property management. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to propose a temporary waqf model for family waqf by establishing its application parameters, which may facilitate the management of family waqf in Malaysia and encourage new donors to establish waqf. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative methodology was employed to analyse the data through deductive and field research methods. For field research, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with the Waqf Corporations and Mufti's Department in the selected states within Malaysia. Findings: Results drawn from the interview's findings are that creating family waqf in Malaysia is hindered by several obstacles, including family waqfs not serving the public interest but rather their descendants, and family waqfs have been practised in perpetuity. Besides, inefficient management of family waqf and a lack of an effective mechanism and parameter exists. Therefore, this study presented a conceptual framework for a temporary cash waqf model for family waqf along with the parameters that can be used to implement it. The temporary waqf is a strategy to develop waqf property and the interests of creators, beneficiaries and trustees. Temporary waqf merged into the family waqf yields benefits to the family waqf. Research limitations/implications: Because of Malaysia's Waqf Regulation and Administration, this study was confined to selected states. This study has broadened the scope of temporary family waqf, including moveable, immovable property and cash waqf. Practical implications: This study presented a temporary waqf model for family waqf as a realistic mechanism and criterion for its practical implementation in Malaysia. Social implications: This study could encourage new donors to establish waqf. Originality/value: This study’s novelty lies in its attempt to highlight the importance of the temporary waqf model as a practical mechanism with holistic principles for its implementation in Malaysia to benefit the donors, their families and trustees. In addition to family waqf, numerous temporary waqfs may be established, in which the income or usufruct is shared proportionally, such as charitable waqf (waqf khairi), private waqf (waqf khas) and joint waqf (waqf mushtarak). © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},
